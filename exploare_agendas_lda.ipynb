       "'I voted in favour of this report. Europe has been paralysed with regard to the migrant crisis. While we keep discussing possible solutions to the grave problem we face, it hardly ever comes to common action. However, even when we do decide on joint measures, we do not follow through on them. The Dublin Agreement and the relocation system have failed utterly, as the Member States have not committed to apply them. We must either effectively enforce the current measures, or introduce new ones. Either way, it is not a problem that can be solved by any Member State alone. It is a dilemma that must be dealt with by the European Union as a whole. It cannot be fixed by closing national borders, but only by guarding our common ones; those defined by Schengen. What we need to do is form a common border guard and coast guard and put a collective reception and relocation system in place. Furthermore, we must prompt Turkey to crack down on the criminals smuggling refugees to Europe under harsh circumstances and we must speak with African governments about returning economic migrants. However, what is most important is that Member States keep to it.'"

      "\tMr President, honourable Members, Europe's migration policy of recent years is untenable. We are witnessing systematic human rights violations at our borders, pushbacks that often go unpunished, and a Dublin system that works neither for the Member States nor for those seeking protection. Therefore, it is clear: in this parliamentary term, Europe finally needs effective solutions for migration and asylum, clear rules for control and solidarity based on our values of democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights, including the right to asylum in Europe. The reform of the Common European Asylum System can contribute to this, but it is also just one piece of the puzzle for a comprehensive migration policy. What is currently missing includes a stronger role for municipalities and civil society, cooperation with countries of origin on an equal footing, without outsourcing our humanitarian responsibility, and not least, simpler and expanded possibilities for legal entry into the EU, also to address our economy's growing need for workers. Only if we tackle these challenges will we succeed in shaping migration sustainably and in the interest of all involved parties in the future. So, much work lies ahead of us in the coming years.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tToday, however, we are discussing the present legislative package, which includes proposals that can only now be concluded after eight years. That we had to wait so long for a reform due to the blockade by the Member States is shameful. Also shameful are the circumstances in which negotiations with the Council took place: instead of a contractually stipulated loyal cooperation between the institutions, there was a Council that refused many compromises, often without clear arguments. Therefore, we are not voting today on a perfect legislative package – it is not even a very good one – and I will not conceal points of criticism: mandatory border procedures without exception for families, inadmissibility decisions for supposedly safe third countries, and instrumentalisation are highly problematic elements, the necessity of which the Council could not even explain. This must be particularly critically monitored during implementation. In my report, the screening, we also had to make concessions – for example, the screening of persons already present in the territory. Here, there are even considerable doubts as to whether the existing legal basis permits this measure.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tNevertheless, the package also contains positive elements: in the screening, for example, important protection measures and uniform standards, or a significantly strengthened, independent fundamental rights monitoring mechanism, which is also extended to the border procedures. Furthermore, solidarity-based cooperation among Member States will become mandatory for the first time – this is an important first step towards shared responsibility – and a resettlement framework will also be introduced. In addition to an individual assessment of the various texts, the overall picture is also important for our decision, and this shows: after years of deadlock in the Council, we have finally succeeded in reaching an agreement on asylum reform. This will enable us to ensure that European law is upheld everywhere in Europe and that Member States, having approved this by qualified majority, also implement it. We also expect the Commission to resume its role as guardian of the Treaties, a role it has neglected or even ignored for far too long, especially under Commission President von der Leyen.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tOur commitment to a solidarity-based and progressive migration policy does not end today. Rather, in addition to the missing elements mentioned at the outset, one of our core tasks in the coming legislative term will be to monitor that the new law is fully implemented – in all Member States and, yes, respecting our fundamental rights, including the right to asylum. Then this reform, too, can be a step in the right direction.\n",

      "\tMr President, Madam Commissioner, dear Ylva Johansson, dear colleagues, we are at a moment of truth. After three and a half years of complex and demanding work, and almost ten years after the Syrian refugee migration crisis, we face a crucial vote to finally reform the European asylum and migration system. This pact is a coherent, complementary set of texts to finally address the migratory challenge, as Europeans. Together, we champion four priority objectives. The first: to ensure strategic steering of European asylum policy among the 27 Member States, with a prominent role for the Commission in coordination and monitoring. The second element: an unprecedented solidarity mechanism at European level to assist Member States in the event of migratory pressure or crisis. The third pillar: to establish better control of irregular immigration at the external borders of the European Union, thanks to accelerated border procedures for applicants manifestly ineligible for asylum. Finally, to implement more harmonised, more effective asylum procedures within the European Union, accompanied by essential rights for minors, for families, and for all asylum seekers. These various legislative instruments will enable the European Union to be better prepared to respond to the main challenges of immigration. This pact will not solve everything, but it is a step forward, a giant leap towards real control and sound, humane management of immigration in France, in Europe, and on our continent. Nor is this the end of the road. We will have to put all our energy, as my colleague Birgit Sippel has just reminded us, into ensuring the implementation and respect of the new rules in all countries of the Union. With my Renew group, we will follow this implementation with extreme vigilance and we count, Madam Commissioner, on the European Commission to fully play its role as guardian of the treaties. Indeed, we have already started working on measures, particularly for families. Dear colleagues, we face our responsibilities: to vote against the pact, offering a victory to the European far right which has done everything to obstruct the development of solutions to migratory challenges (in our country, France, for example, it is the Rassemblement National that does not want solutions, cynically feeding off problems); or to vote for this pact responsibly. Dear elected colleagues from centrist and pro-European parties, I call on you to support this pact. Our fellow citizens want action, not grand speeches.\n",
      "[x] 4: Tomas Tobé (PPE - christian_conservative) [39% migration]\n",
      "\tMr President, Commissioners, today, we have an historic opportunity to finally put in place a common European migration policy. After migration crisis after migration crisis, after political failure after political failure, we can finally deliver to the European citizens. Most of us understand that if we have a common external border, we also need more common migration policy. The EPP Group will support the migration pact. We think that it is crucial that we start to take back control from the smugglers, because we need to decide who will actually enter the European Union. We need to strengthen our common border, because only so can we also ensure that we move towards a policy when we can give protection to those in need and not to irregular migrants. We also, in the migration pact, finally acknowledge that we need to cooperate also with third countries if we want to manage migration in a better way in the future. Finally, and perhaps even more important: in the migration pact, we make it clear that we need to cooperate better within the Union. It cannot be so that this comes to responsibility for a few Member States, where we try to find different ad hoc solutions. Now we make it clear that it is a responsibility for everyone to contribute. This is basically about building trust: building trust between the Member States, but also building trust from the citizens that the European politicians actually can deliver also when it comes to migration. Yes, the negotiations have been long – and let’s be honest, they have been hard, even within this House and together with the Council. But from the EPP Group, I would like to thank for the cooperation with the S&D Group and the Renew Group, and also with some responsible delegations in the ECR Group. But I still hear many colleagues in this House now that are ready to do whatever it takes to stop the migration pact. And I would like to turn to The Left Group and the Greens Group. You very often give speeches about the far right, but the truth is today you want to stop the migration pact together with Le Pen and AfD. That is the truth. You should instead vote in favour of the migration pact because then we could put a stop to the horrific numbers of deaths on the Mediterranean Sea. Don’t leave this in the hands of the smugglers. Colleagues, today we have an opportunity to send a clear message: Europe can agree also on divisive issues. Let’s move away from the political deadlock. Let’s move forward to a migration policy that actually works for everyone and that will, for certain, work better than what we have today. Vote in favour of the migration pact. Vote in favour for Europe.\n",
      "[x] 5: Juan Fernando López Aguilar (PSE/S&D - social_democratic) [45% migration]\n",
      "\tMr. President, Mr. Vice-President, Madam Commissioner, Members of the European Parliament, today we are undertaking a decisive, indeed a defining, vote, not only looking at the past and present of the European Parliament, but, above all, looking towards the future. Because it is, to begin with, about fulfilling a mandate of European Law, of the Treaty of Lisbon and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union: that there be a common migration system, with a common European migration policy and legislation, and a common asylum system, with an asylum policy and legislation that provide added value to the unilateral, fragmented, and insufficient solutions of the Member States, which we have described as unsustainable, as well as unjust. It is about, therefore, finally bringing European law into force, and doing so, moreover, with respect for our values and by providing a joint approach to the five Regulations, which are five directly binding laws. One of them is the Regulation on crisis situations, which is not the ordinary response, but the response to situations in which a Member State declares itself overwhelmed by a massive or quantitatively very significant, very impactful arrival of irregular migrants, especially after search and rescue operations, also at regional and island scales. This therefore requires an articulated European solidarity mechanism, a European response cushion, a European solidarity that involves the Commission with an implementing act and also the Council through the Commission's Recommendation to elevate its offers of solidarity to all Member States, either through orderly relocation programs, finally coordinated by a European coordinator, or through contributions to the Asylum and Migration Fund, which help Member States to equip themselves to offer an adequate response to these emergency situations. It is about, therefore, finally enacting predictable European legislation with legal certainty in areas where there has only been action-reaction until now. It is also about doing so with common guarantees, in particular through the protection of people in the most vulnerable situations, such as women, women with dependent children, unaccompanied minors and, of course, victims of trafficking. These situations require differentiated treatment, and that is what we have fought hard for in the negotiation with this Council. Of course, we are aware that this issue has not been easy. In fact, it has been the most divisive and thorny issue on the European agenda for too long. Therefore, the negotiation has not been easy in this European Parliament, and certainly it has not been easy with the 27 interior ministries, which is the Council with which we have addressed the final phase. It must be said that in every negotiation concessions must be made and the result has limitations. But the result, if it offers legal certainty and guarantees, is always better than no result at all. Of course, it is better than leaving things as they are. It is better than abandoning the governments of the Member States to their fate. It is better than sending the message that, every time there is an emergency migration situation in island situations such as in the Canary Islands, Lampedusa, or the Greek islands, the response simply has to be strictly national and no solidarity can be expected from the European Union. No, that cannot be the future of the European Union, nor can it be the message for the elections on June 9th. The message must be that we have done everything in our power. Have we done everything? No. It remains, of course, to fulfil our own mandate to establish a coordinated European search and rescue mechanism, and to jointly and effectively fight against criminal organizations that traffic and exploit people, as well as to continue opening legal and safe pathways that give an opportunity to people fleeing desperation to reach Europe without risking their lives in the attempt or tragically losing them, as has been happening for too long. The two options are clear: either rules are established with guarantees, with all the limits and all the criticisms that one specific point or another may have raised, which is inevitable in such a complex negotiation, or Member States are simply abandoned to their fate. The situation could worsen even further if, after all the accumulated work and all the energy and time we have consumed on this, the message were that we have not succeeded, because much worse than the situation as it is—which is already unbearable—is to have tried and failed. Taking a step forward, with all its limitations and also with guarantees, is within our reach if we vote in favor of each of the Regulations, of the European laws that make up this pact.\n",

The Eurodac reform is about to be voted on: a harmonised, revised, expanded database to improve the identification of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers who attempt to cross or cross our borders, enter or are found on European territory without legal grounds for their presence on our soil.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tA new database no longer built on asylum applications, but on individual records, to put an end to the fraud of those who go to several countries seeking international protection or residence permits based on social integration, seeking to deceive national authorities and obtain papers in some Member State. Perhaps that is why many NGOs and associations that cooperate—by action or omission—with the illicit trafficking of people are so concerned with Eurodac.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tWe have achieved it: a database in which we will record not only fingerprints, but also facial images, travel documents—or their absence—and any incident that constitutes an alert for Europe's internal security. Eurodac will come to include beneficiaries of the different forms of international protection, to prevent secondary movements within the European space of those who already have protection in one country and to prevent abuses of protection systems and social security.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tBy including facial images and travel documents, it will facilitate the work of authorities in identifying those who carry false documents or those who try to frustrate their identification by authorities at the border—as is now happening massively in Spain—since there will be a security alert. Lowering the age for data collection from fourteen to six years will allow for a more complete picture of arrivals and, above all, facilitate reunification with parents, with whom minors should be, and not in the hands of associations that profit from them in flats or reception centers.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tThe message we send is clear: our law must be obeyed, and if you do not obey it, we will identify you, we will pursue you, and we will return you to your place of origin. Eurodac does not solve the problem of illegal immigration, but it is a first step: to identify and register. Much remains to be done. How many illegal immigrants enter via the Canary Islands today with records of terrorism or serious crimes in their countries, and European authorities are unaware of it?\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tCooperation with third countries requires demanding that they upload data from their national criminal records and that these also be included in Eurodac to be used as grounds for refusal of entry. The next steps will have to be taken in the next legislature: ensuring that Morocco, Algeria, or Mauritania actively cooperate to cut off the Canary Islands routes and the Western Mediterranean routes, and in any case, accept returns ordered by our authorities at the border—of all individuals—using all legitimate means at our disposal, including, of course, the suspension of trade agreements or the payment of development aid.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tThe institution of residence permits based on social integration in European territory must be repealed as an illegitimate and fraudulent way of obtaining them; border protection must be strengthened; the pull factor must be discouraged by prohibiting extraordinary regularisations of illegal immigrants in the European space; and states that comply with the expulsion of illegals must be rewarded, not those that fail to comply.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tCertain mafias and bad neighbours have declared war on us. Their moralistic capitalism is an insult to our intelligence. NGOs and the Left give us a moral lecture, but in reality, they work for the predators who will use these illegals as cheap labour, driving down wages and condemning Europeans to unemployment, insecurity, and ruin. The majority of Europeans no longer want these types of policies. The majority of Europeans know that we must change course to protect our security, to protect our employment, and to protect the future of European nations. Eurodac is only the first step.\n",

      "\tThank you, Mr. President! The Left is deeply critical of the agreement being debated and voted on today. Hundreds of NGOs and organisations working on refugee solidarity, life-saving, and support for people seeking protection here in Europe have been very clear: we MEPs should say no to this agreement. Today's vote, which we will have later this evening, does not solve the problems it is supposed to solve. There will be no automatic redistribution of those seeking protection; instead, the first country of arrival remains responsible. There will be no real solidarity. Nothing, absolutely nothing, is being done to stop the deaths in the Mediterranean. On the contrary. The increasingly closed borders will lead to more brutality, increasingly dangerous routes, and greater risks. Instead, we get more of what doesn't work, and I wish more of you had been there to see what it looks like at the EU's borders. We will see more systematic detention, imprisonment of people at the EU's borders with the dehumanisation that entails. We will see more violence and degradation, and believe me, there is already a lot of that brutality even now. We will see deterrence and confinement. We will see more cooperation with dictatorships and despots. It started with Turkey, as you surely remember. But now we are here. The so-called Libyan coast guard, which consists of militias that force people back to torture and violence. We are going to cooperate with Tunisia, Egypt. All to stop people on the run. One of the most serious problems with this agreement is that the individual right to asylum is being attacked. It is being undermined in a terrible way, as EU countries will say that you and you and you came from a so-called safe third country and you will not even have your protection grounds examined. That is to say, we will not even assess your protection grounds. That is, de facto, rendering the right to asylum null and void. And some of you, far too many here, say that nothing else could have been achieved. We've heard that before, haven't we? It's called TINA – There Is No Alternative. But why engage in politics if you are here to dystopically follow in the footsteps of the far-right and right-wing nationalism? That is certainly not the path of the Left. All of us, and I mean all of us here from all political families, know that we can do so much better. And we have shown it. When Putin's bombs fall on Ukrainian citizens, then we ensure protection for those who must flee. That is the path we should have chosen. That is still the path we should choose. Not this brutal, dehumanising way. There is one proposal that stands out in today's package, and that is the Left's proposal, which we have worked on, and for which I have been the rapporteur. It concerns a European quota refugee system. It concerns a humanitarian system. There, we provide protection, a safe path for people, the most vulnerable refugees. We cooperate with the UN, with UNHCR. We ensure that we provide support and aid, that we support those countries that receive a great many refugees, often millions. That is what we do in the Left. We roll up our sleeves when the rest of your political families want to close borders, increase brutality, and abolish the right to asylum. But then, we in the Left open legal, safe migration routes. This system for quota refugees is not obligatory for member states to participate in. But it is a way for people to reach safety and security to seek protection here in Europe. I am proud of that. I hope that every single member state takes this chance to offer protection to people seeking it here in Europe. And I promise you, that is the Europe the citizens want to see. They do not want to be part of a dystopian Europe where the only choice is to trudge along with the nationalist right. We know we can do so much better than that. So make sure to vote in the Left and humanitarian forces into this Parliament when you get the chance in June.\n",

      "\tEurope is at a crossroads. Migration and asylum policy are among the most divisive issues for our citizens and for politics in general, and often a means of manipulation, extortion, and excuses. We have felt the consequences everywhere, including in the Schengen area. Reform of the entire field of migration was essential. In the long run, the survival of the Union as such also depends on it. So, after eight years of blockades and several attempts, we have succeeded. Later, we will vote on the entire package of renewed migration and asylum legislation. With these, Europe enters a new era. What we have on the table is not a perfect solution; it is a compromise. However, reform is a strategic necessity that we in the European Parliament are adopting with a heavy heart. But we are not shying away from our responsibility. This is what European citizens, above all, expect from us. I myself was the rapporteur for the reform of the Qualification Regulation. The bulk of the text was already agreed in 2018, but Europe and the world were different then. I am convinced that such a text would no longer be possible to adopt today, given the current circumstances in the EU. So, the proposed Qualification Regulation was part of the first unsuccessful asylum policy reform in 2016. The regulation will replace the existing Qualification Directive and sets out in one place the standards regarding the conditions for obtaining international protection in the Union – either refugee status or subsidiary protection status – and, on the other hand, the rights of beneficiaries in the event of a positive decision. This regulation is, therefore, a key component of the future European asylum system and will ensure equal treatment of applications across Europe. This will help deter 'asylum shopping' and thereby indirectly reduce the phenomenon of secondary migration. Until now, the application of the directive has been very arbitrary among countries. They had to implement the directive into national law and also enforce it. However, there were significant variations and deviations in this process. We know of cases where, for example, an applicant for international protection from Afghanistan had virtually no chance of a positive decision in one Member State, while having an almost one hundred percent chance in another Member State. Let us hope, therefore, that such stories will be a thing of the past and that Europe will truly come alive in this area too. Allow me now to focus on the main substantive highlights. Among the main achievements of the Qualification Regulation, I certainly count the uniform minimum length of residence permits. This will be valid for at least 3 years for refugee status, and for subsidiary protection status, a minimum of one year, followed by a minimum of two years upon renewal. Status review will not be automatic and mandatory. Indeed, the beneficiary's status is maintained as long as there is a need for their protection. I am particularly proud of this success. We also succeeded in broadening the definition of family for the purposes of the regulation. A novelty of the regulation is the assessment of the availability of internal protection. Thanks to this House, we have significantly limited the application of this principle. This will only be mandatory in cases where the persecution of the applicant is not carried out by the state. Refugees will also receive greater protection due to the faster issuance of residence permits. These must also be free of charge. Henceforth, the period of residence that counts towards obtaining a permanent residence permit will be calculated from the date of application, and not, as before, only half the time from application to recognition of protection. The processing of applications can, in some cases, take more than a year, which is why this change is more than important, it is extremely important. Furthermore, beneficiaries will be treated equally with citizens of the host country regarding rights such as social and healthcare, rights concerning access to work, and, of course, education. Moreover, unaccompanied minors, who are a particularly vulnerable category, will now be entitled to greater protection and safeguards. In this case too, I am proud of the European Parliament's success. Esteemed colleagues, hoping for a favourable outcome, I thank you for your cooperation and attention.\n",

      "\tMr President, Commissioner, colleagues, big majority of Europeans want a humane and controlled European migration policy, and that is why we have to end years of chaos and inhumane circumstances, because we will not be able to explain to our voters that we end this term in chaos. We’ve witnessed in recent years the total collapse of trust between the Member States. We’ve seen pushbacks and violence at the external borders, inhumane reception conditions and asylum seekers sleeping on the streets of the richest countries on this planet. Over the past eight years, we’ve worked tirelessly for a package that is in line with our values, while the political climate is getting chillier by the day. Compromises have been reached just before Christmas with great difficulty, and I find it tragic that this House found itself defending European values against the Council because, regretfully, many governments are not upholding those same values, and they will aim to deny as many asylum claims as possible and put as many people in indefinite detention as they can, including children. That is why the European Commission needs to be tough and enforce the law that we’re going to vote today. The European Commission will have to do a lot more to convince us that it will actually enforce the new pact, because in recent years it allowed human rights violations to happen and it didn’t lift a finger, I’m sorry to say. Dirty deals with Tunisia, colleagues, cannot be considered a confidence-building measure either, for that matter. But this House also has a responsibility. We will have to hold the European Commission to account, and we have not done so for the last five years. If we’re criticising the Commission – and I am criticising the Commission – we also have to acknowledge that we let the Commission get away with it for the past five years and we didn’t lift a finger. Today in the vote, the far right will be showing its true colours. It will vote against because it doesn’t really want solutions. It wants chaos and misery to continue because that’s what they feed on. There are also colleagues who will vote against for understandable and legitimate reasons, and I share many of their concerns. But I still think that we should endorse the package because we have a responsibility as politicians – because if we reject the pact, there will be nothing in its place. There’s not going to be a better alternative, but we’ll end up with a situation where no single rule will be respected anymore and we’ll end in a race to the bottom and the end to the right of asylum in Europe. We cannot, unfortunately, legislate away an ultra-right majority because even if you reject the package, that majority will still be there and it may actually be bigger in the next term. And are you going to entrust the next Parliament with the elaboration of our asylum policies? Well, not me, colleagues, not me. With regard to my own file – the Reception Conditions Directive – we’ve obtained many guarantees and safeguards for asylum seekers, especially for the most vulnerable. We have ensured a legal representative for all unaccompanied children from the day they arrive. We made sure that the detention of children is the absolute exception and only with judicial authorisation. We’ve guaranteed asylum seekers access to education and language courses and quicker access to the labour market. We ensured specific attention for vulnerable groups like women, children and LGBTIQ people, and the standards laid down in the Reception Conditions Directive will apply to the entire package, and upholding all of these elements in the implementation of the pact is crucial, because it can only work if it has the trust of everyone. The weakness lies not in the legal text, colleagues, that is quite clear. It lies in the implementation by the Member States and enforcement by the European Commission. So today we need to prove the cynics wrong and show that asylum is a European matter requiring a European response in line with our European values – and we take responsibility.\n",

      "\tMr./Madam President, today we are voting on a fundamental revision of European asylum policy. Nine years after the 2015 crisis, a plan is finally on the table that puts an end to the chaos and suffering at our external borders. This plan entails strict screening and reception at those external borders, distinguishing between genuine refugees and migrants from safe countries, with mandatory border procedures and return for the latter group, and more solidarity within Europe. In other words: with this Migration Pact, we are finally gaining control over migration. Finally, it will no longer be human traffickers but the Member States that determine who gains access to the EU. Of course, a compromise like this is rarely perfect. Not all challenges will be solved as if by magic. But it is a very important first step on which we must build further. Let us not delude ourselves. A vote against this Pact is not a vote for better policy. No, a vote against is a vote for maintaining the current situation, for years more of high influxes of illegal migration, for overcrowded reception centres and a lack of control at the external borders, for the business model of human traffickers and their life-threatening routes. A vote against today is a vote for the status quo. That is where the far-left – and I include the Greens in that – and the far-right are trying to find common ground today. Horseshoe theory in its purest form. A dark coalition between Frans Timmermans and Geert Wilders, while people across Europe have been concerned about migration for years and rightly expect the European Union to act. That is a colossal responsibility for all of us here in this chamber today. Let us not shirk that responsibility.\n",

And it is perhaps truly one of the most important decisions we will take in this legislative term – and it is certainly also one of the hardest for many. But in fact, European citizens are currently looking at us and seeing whether, after years of blockages and negotiations, we manage to truly get to grips with this. And does the Pact solve all problems? No. Is it better than the status quo? Yes, and many have already pointed that out. And I know that this Pact also contains points that are painful, and I too feel that, for example, when I see that families with small children are not particularly protected in border procedures. But nothing else was possible with the Member States. And if Europe is not able to act in this area, which is a core area because it can only be resolved at a European level, then that only fuels the right-wingers, those who seek to divide, those who want chaos and who are banking on Europe being incapable of action.

This is a historic moment because for a long time we have been trying to work towards European solutions when it comes to migration. I understand the various individual interests. I understand the emotions, but these always block the solutions. So it is about responsibility. In my opinion, all those who negotiated have shown their responsibility. But everything also depends on the people who may not have been so closely involved in the negotiations on the legislation. It is your responsibility to vote. If you vote against, you vote for maintaining the current situation: a major humanitarian drama, no control over migration. So only by working together and making your voice heard for this Pact, do we take a step forward. It is not ideal. It can always be better in various respects, but we are taking a step forward.

This pact offers no solution to better manage arrivals, to end deaths in the Mediterranean, human trafficking, reception crises in our Member States, violations of fundamental rights, or the right to asylum. The pact, on the contrary, seals this Fortress Europe in its texts and its collaboration with dictatorships.

On the other hand, the loss of security in our cities, the increase in undeclared work with the consequent compression of workers' rights, the hateful exploitation of women, the spread of Islamic radicalism with its most violent manifestations. Improving the current situation: this is the only reason to vote in favour of some of the regulations in the new Pact. A few steps in the right direction, few but important, with the hope of continuing on this path with greater resolve during the next European legislature. Departures must be stopped by collaborating with the migrants' countries of origin and transit, establishing first who has the right to enter Europe and who does not. This is the only possible structural solution, also by helping developing nations to remove the causes of emigration. This is what we have been trying for years to make the left understand, that they would like to let everyone in, indiscriminately, and then give them the right to vote and thus supplant the will of our populations. The 71% decrease in landings in Italy and the drastic reduction in deaths at sea confirm the effectiveness of the Meloni government's choice to prevent arrivals, working patiently and with determination on the external dimension of European borders.

Reception or financial contribution from states – this is how President Macron's representatives here summarize this pact, with their characteristic out-of-touch tone. It is, in reality, submersion or punishment. Our countries will be forced to host thousands of migrants in their towns and villages, or else pay, and pay dearly, to be spared.

We will therefore oppose this pact of submersion, with its incessant pull factors, with the brutality by which you inflict upon the peoples migratory waves that they no longer desire.

We have wrestled in this House, we have argued, we have debated, we have listened and explored, we have repeatedly pulled things back together. We were so often deadlocked, we left negotiating rooms, and precisely when things got difficult, we kept searching for the delicate balance that the Pact ultimately entails. That is the strength of this House, which is capable of so much more than it sometimes shows. Today we stand here and decide whether all these efforts, all these debates, have been worthwhile, whether they were right or in vain.

It is about no longer ceding control to criminal networks and traffickers over who comes to us and who does not. It is about correcting the mistakes of 2019.

We are indeed willing to take responsibility for an asylum policy.

      "\tMr. President, Honourable Members, this umpteenth debate precedes a very important vote which will tell us if we will have an Asylum and Migration Pact. The Lega delegation has, during these years of work, called for preventing departures by defending borders without having to risk prison, as is happening today to Minister Salvini; for establishing identification centres in transit countries managed by European agencies; and for strengthening cooperation agreements to facilitate repatriations. These are common sense proposals aimed at stopping that criminal business which you are well aware of and even facilitate. But the Pact on the table today, with the exception of very few useful provisions, fails to achieve any objective. It is a compromise at all costs, in search of a majority but offering neither solutions nor protections. There is no protection for the desperate people crossing the desert, as they will remain at the mercy of criminals. There is no protection in our territories, lands now conquered and subject to the danger of terrorism. There is no protection for European society and culture from those who think, with your complicity, that they can subjugate it. You shamelessly repeat that cheap labour is needed, and if this is the only reason – we want to believe it – have the dignity to legally co-opt them. You will find us on the barricades, because for us, whoever arrives in Europe must do so legally to be integrated into our civilization and not become either a slave or a criminal. This is not the Europe we want, but we will build it with courage, consistency, common sense, and without ideology.\n",

The Council and the majority of this House do nothing against the dying at sea at our borders; the construction of new border fences is much more important to them. They vote for border procedures in which even families with infants are imprisoned. They vote for there to be no binding reception criteria for refugees. But what they cannot vote away is the resistance against this policy. Empathy and humanity cannot even be struck down with an axe. Sea rescuers, activists, NGOs do not stop helping refugees, just as the Turkish Muslim woman in Edirne who daily provides refugees with food – to this day. Let me conclude with a Catholic priest whom I met in Iraq in 2015, in the middle of the war, when the terrorist organization Daesh killed and abducted thousands of people and this priest opened his church to refugees, regardless of their religion. He said to us: \"There are the military positions of Daesh, and here is my church.

After more than a decade of deadlock, the European Union has reached an agreement on the Pact on Migration and Asylum, or I hope it can be achieved. The timing could not be more opportune, as last year's figures bring us closer to a crisis similar to that of 2015. That is why the EPP Group supports this pact to strengthen the protection of our external borders and prevent threats to the security of our citizens. It is a balance between responsibility and solidarity that eases the pressure particularly on frontline countries, such as Spain, while at the same time providing guarantees to those who genuinely need international protection. United against the pact, as expected, are the extremes: the naive do-goodism on one side and alarmist fatalism on the other.

To determine our vote, let us ask ourselves three questions. Does the Pact address the indignity in the treatment of migrants? Does it address the disorder at the borders? Does it lead Member States to demonstrate collective responsibility and solidarity? In all three cases, the answer is no. And I add: alas! Indeed, it is clear that while we do not know what the Pact will truly achieve, we do know that it will not solve the problems denounced by the Member States. Worse still, it marks unprecedented setbacks for fundamental rights while generalising derogating procedures. Thus, there is the impression of doing something, but without a solution for frontline countries, for example, and without a binding principle of solidarity. Let everyone be aware, furthermore, that the Pact does not address major issues. It is silent on relations with countries of origin for migration and asylum. It will have no effect on the movement of people. It makes no mention of the enormous resources that nevertheless need to be deployed concerning the Pact. It says nothing about the deadly business of smugglers, nor about the necessity of a European 'Search and Rescue' operation, nor about legal pathways. It speaks even less about integration and avoids reflection on climate migration and asylum. It is impossible to support it.\n",

But I am extremely worried that these rules systematically lock up asylum seekers – even families with children – at the external borders, for months on end. This law erodes the rights and safeguards of asylum seekers and risks dangerous deportations. It allows for undermining the common standards, which is exactly the opposite of what we need.

Next, you introduced forced relocation to countries like Poland or the payment of a migration tax, 20,000 euros per immigrant. What have you actually done? In reality, you've sent a love letter to human traffickers, encouraging them to push as many people as possible into the sea, because it's known they will be accepted anyway, without any criteria.

Firstly, you'll line the pockets of smugglers, many people will drown, you'll create problems for Europe, you'll extract money from countries like Poland, and you won't solve any problem.

That is why I once again call on all members of centrist and pro-European parties to support this pact, and finally to act for immigration control and for true European solidarity. Specifically, I briefly remind you, thanks to the Pact, we are putting an end to situations of chaos at the Union's borders and in our territories, such as in Calais, for example, in France. Thanks to the Pact, we will significantly reduce the presence of irregular migrants on European soil. Thanks to the Pact, we will make our asylum procedures more efficient, more harmonized, and more respectful of migrants. Colleagues, to act or to prevent, that is our choice today. With my colleagues from the Renew Europe group, we are determined to act and to unequivocally support this European pact on asylum and migration.\n",

      "\tMadam President, Commissioner, I think it is clear for everyone that is watching what is happening on the ground today, and they understand that we need to have a new European migration policy. We have horrific numbers of people dying in the Mediterranean Sea. We still see that the majority of people coming to Europe are irregular migrants. We see that we have a lack of trust between Member States, and we also see that we have a lack of trust also from citizens towards governments, towards European politicians. Now, finally, we have something on the table. We have something that is truly negotiated, and we have an opportunity now to find a constructive majority in this House to vote in favour of this migration pact. For years, this House has criticised the Council for not making up their mind, for not being ready to negotiate. Now, finally, we have the Council ready to adopt this and move forward towards a true European migration policy. Should it then be this House who rejects it? Who shows that we are not mature enough to take decisions that would actually mean that we will stick to our European values? Yes, we will have a more controlled migration policy than we have today, but we will also make a choice that we will prioritise the people in need of protection and we will decrease irregular migration. Finally, we will also open up to cooperate more within the Union and together with countries outside of Europe. This is the right path forward and I do hope, colleagues, you will please be responsible today. Please vote in favour of the Migration Pact.\n",

      "\tMadam President, the European Parliament is the only directly elected supranational and legislative institution in the world. We are the democratic expression of the irreducible diversity and complexity of European integration. We come from our 27 Member States, which have not dissolved with the European Union, and we are going to elections on June 9th. And I say this to recall that the legislative procedure from which we come has been extremely difficult. How could it not be? In no way can the negotiators who have participated in it be entirely satisfied, and I am not. I have heard legitimate criticisms, and I respect them. Of course, I have also heard disinformation with refutable arguments as soon as one reads the content of the European Regulations that we are going to approve —I hope— in this session, which is historic. But I profess great respect for those who have criticised it from humanitarian organisations. I want to remind you that there are first-rank international organisations —the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and the International Organization for Migration— that have welcomed the Pact as a step forward and positive. But to those humanitarian organisations that have criticised it, I say: I have made their criticisms my own, I have fought for them in every negotiation, I have battled with all my strength to make their points of view prevail. But, at the same time, I state: we are members of the European Parliament and we are not activists. In this Parliament, we have been elected to decide and legislate, not to indefinitely utter impassioned, but sterile speeches. We have been elected to assume the responsibility of making decisions. And I want to say that the alternative to not voting on each of the Regulations of this Pact is worse. It is not only condemning things to remain as they are, with all our protests, with every plenary session saying «shame, what a shame that the European Union continues to do nothing regarding the migratory phenomenon and the right to asylum». It is not recognising that we have tried and failed. It is something much worse and more disheartening for the future because it will be telling the voters: forget it, the European Union is not capable of responding even when it sets its mind to it and when it spends so many years on the effort. That is why I say: let us not lose the opportunity. It is now or never. After all these years of work, it is worth taking a step forward, with all its limitations, but also establishing order, guarantees, and common rules where there have been none until now. We are going to vote favourably on each of the Regulations of this European Pact.\n",

      "\tMadam President, I thank, above all, those who have attacked Eurodac. Their attacks are the main proof that we are right and that Eurodac goes to the heart of the problem. Illegal immigration is a business from which thousands of people are getting rich. Please, Members on this side , read the Frontex reports. The latest Frontex report literally states that human traffickers in Mauritania have been cramming increasingly large numbers of migrants into pirogues, which puts the lives of those on board in greater danger. Those who endanger people's lives are the traffickers and all those in Europe who call them to come, because these people are not fleeing persecution. In Africa, the only ones being persecuted are Christians murdered by jihadist militias, but you pay little attention to them. Look, on the Central Mediterranean route, protected by Italy, illegal immigration has fallen by 60%. On the Balkan route, protected by Hungary, illegal immigration has fallen by 70%. However, in the other two gateways to Europe —the Western Mediterranean and the Canary Islands route— it has increased by 50% and 540% during these two months of 2024. Yesterday, all Members of the Spanish Congress of Deputies —except those from my party— voted in favour of an amnesty for 500,000 illegal immigrants for an extraordinary regularisation. Why not a million? Thousands of illegal immigrants from Islamic countries are today on social media —the Commissioner will surely know this—, on Facebook, Twitter, and all social media, calling for massive entry into Europe via the Spanish route. This is the reality. These are all those subsidised entities, associations, and NGOs that have been blocking our emails for weeks in an unbearable campaign, but, if they live off illegal immigration, by what authority do they tell us what to vote for? We do not serve lobbies; we serve the voters. Eurodac has been the first stone of these foundations, and in the next legislative term, we will raise the pillars of a beautiful building where law, justice, and security prevail.\n",

      "\tMadam President, I have heard many arguments today, but the one I’ve heard most is: we have to have a deal. We just have to have a deal. But a deal must be judged on its contents. I repeat why we in The Left will vote against this deal. There is no solution to solidarity. There is no shared responsibility to receive asylum seekers. There is no stop to the death in the Mediterranean. Nothing. There will be systematic detention in the borders of Europe. The right to asylum will be dismantled. And there will be more deals with dictators and anti-democratic regimes. Just hear those arguments. So, in The Left, we stand for fundamental rights. We also stand with all those organisations that are demonstrating now outside this building. But they are also working every day to save lives, to demonstrate what it is with solidarity. Look at them and listen to them, please. People here like to say that we are anti-European; I would say you are anti-European. We defend a Europe that stands up for fundamental rights. What do you think people want in the future? What do you think the young people of Europe want? They want a Europe that stands for democracy, human rights, solidarity and fundamental rights. They want workers’ rights and they want climate justice. That’s the Europe they want to build, and they are not okay with us taking decisions that dismantle that future. You say we play into the hands of the far right. I would laugh if it wasn’t so serious. You are walking in their shoes. You are following on their leash, in their narrative, pitting people against each other, pitting migrants and refugees against workers, against young people, against families. You must stop. Instead, start to defend people’s rights – all people’s rights – because that’s the future that we have promised to build together for this Europe: a Europe that protects people, that doesn’t deny them rights. It starts anywhere. It starts everywhere. It starts today with refugee rights.\n",

      "\tMadam President, Honourable Members, thank you sincerely for this debate. This very clearly illustrates the state of the European Union today and also outlines the dangers that could befall Europe if we fail to adopt this package today. We all recognise that the entire package – the solution before us – is not perfect, but it is a compromise. However, there is no alternative to this package. If we were to reject it today, Europe would be plunged into great uncertainty. This would primarily embolden populist forces. Adopting the package is therefore a strategic necessity for the European Union and is our shared responsibility. And immediately afterwards, we will have to focus on implementation. Undoubtedly, there will also be certain challenges and difficulties in this process, and we will have to address them as they arise. There is simply no other way, Honourable Members. This is also what European citizens expect of us. In conclusion, therefore, I once again appeal to all colleagues: support the package! It is not ideal, but there is no alternative. Thank you to all colleagues for your support and cooperation.\n",

      "\tMadam President, as I stated earlier, I will support the package, but I will do so without joy. Now, every one of us in this room has his or her own reasons for voting in favour or against. And I’d like to say to the EPP: no, Greens and Left are not on the same side of the far right if they vote against. I think that’s dishonest. And no, friends of the Greens and Left, those voting in favour, like me, are not on the same side of the far right or anti-European. I have concerns and doubt, and I too struggle with the dilemma. But that is why we are in politics. Because having an opinion is easy. Voting for something perfect is not very difficult, but to take responsibility for dilemmas and difficult decisions is our job. The pact definitely contains problematic elements, risks and weaknesses and it is dishonest to deny that. But it is equally dishonest to claim that this pact is the end of the right to asylum, or that, in itself, it will lead to more violence at the borders. The violence today is not the result of the existing law, but of national policies and the absence of enforcement. I can defend the new Reception Conditions Directive without any hesitation, and those standards (which I had the pleasure to negotiate) will apply across the package. And if I had written the pact, it would look very different. But there will not be any fresh proposals on the table or a better negotiation result. It is false to create that impression and our job does not end here. We have an even bigger task in overseeing implementation and enforcement, and the best guarantee for European values is a solid majority of European liberal democrats who stand tall for human rights. So let’s make it happen in June.\n",

      "\tThe provisions of this migration pact try at all costs to create the impression that the problem with the influx of illegal migrants is controlled and orderly, and the situation – safe. Nothing could be further from the truth. I fear that only now will smugglers, these human traffickers, start behaving like sharks that have smelled blood. Because criminals driving this bloody business see the prospect of even greater profits from this illicit trade. Since Europe declares its readiness to accept illegal migrants, criminals will push them even more numerously onto dilapidated boats and propel them north towards Spain, Italy, or Greece. Fires are extinguished in the bud, and they are not extinguished with gasoline. That is why we proposed that aid for those in need be provided on the spot, in the countries from which migrants flee to Europe, but we were not listened to. We warned against creating once again the deceptive atmosphere of \"Herzlich willkommen,\" which did not prove effective even during Angela Merkel's time, and will certainly not prove effective now. The provisions of this pact will not help reduce the number of illegal migrants, but will further increase their influx into Europe. Even the authors of this document themselves have many doubts and do not hide their dissatisfaction with its provisions. This policy on migration must be decisively changed!\n",

      "\tChanges in human migration require reforms from Europe; relying on old regulations would not have been a solution. The package as a whole takes responsibility for more controlled migration, and even strict measures must be implementable when necessary. The Union is, however, also a continent where people can come and which is safe for them. The package also includes a crisis regulation, important for Finland, for situations where asylum seekers are instrumentalized as part of hybrid influencing. The situation at our eastern border has shown that we will need even more extensive tools for crises. I consider it important that we now get clear rules for the entire EU's Eastern border for situations where Russia seeks to instrumentalize asylum seekers through hybrid influencing. From Finland's perspective, this matter is particularly about national security. The package is a compromise where no one wins everything. The package now approved clarifies legislation as necessary and also aims to prevent organized crime, such as human smuggling. The new, updated rules are an improvement to the current unsustainable situation where old rules were not followed.\n",

      "\tIn 2015, at the peak of migratory pressure, when over 1.8 million irregular migrants entered the EU, Europe failed! Ten years later, Europe faces the second largest flow of migrants. In the first two months of 2024 alone, the number of people who illegally crossed the EU borders is over 30,000, the second highest level since the 2015–2016 crisis. The increase is by 541% on the West African route and by 117% on the Eastern Mediterranean route. Amidst all this, there is also positive news. Frontex reports a 70% decrease in the number of illegal border crossings on the Central Mediterranean route, and a 65% decrease on the Balkan route. Bulgaria, which guards one of the most challenging external borders, that with Turkey, also reports a decrease in migratory pressure. The country notes over a 40% decrease in the number of detained irregular migrants compared to the previous year. A prerequisite for this is the successful implementation of the pilot project with the Commission, which allows for a significant strengthening of border control capacity, accelerated asylum application procedures, and effective returns. For all this, Bulgaria was commended at a hearing of the LIBE Committee, where the Commission cited us as an example of good practices for the entire EU regarding the protection of external borders and migration management.\n",

      "\tAfter eight years of negotiations, an agreement has finally been reached on the migration and asylum policy package. This is a significant step. It is regrettable that some political groups are now attempting to derail this long-negotiated package after all these years. It is clear that the outcome is not perfect, but it unifies asylum policy and streamlines operations at the external borders. The collapse of the package would mean a continuation of the current situation, which is not functional for anyone. Responsibility for migration issues has been unevenly distributed for too long. All EU Member States must bear their share of this responsibility. The new rules now combine binding responsibility with flexibility, allowing Member States to choose their mode of participation. For Finland, as an external border country, it is particularly important that we have unified, efficient practices and information exchange at the EU borders, as well as mutual support among Member States. In the future, we will be better able to combat the abuse of the system. The guarantee of international protection must be ensured for those who need it. At the same time, unfounded applications must be efficiently screened, and necessary return decisions must be made. It is good that the package also provides more means to combat the instrumentalisation of migration in crisis situations, but it does not fully resolve it yet. This theme will likely need to be revisited. But now a significant common foundation has been laid. While the package is an important improvement to the current situation, it does not solve everything. For the future success of the entire EU, there is a great need to open more functional channels for labour migration. Europe is becoming the world's oldest continent, and millions of workers across the entire economic area will be retiring in the coming years. New experts, entrepreneurs, and workers are needed. In the future, there will be increasing competition for them, even within the EU.\n",

      "\tMr President, I thank Vice-President Schinas for his very comprehensive presentation. The European Union is going through a very serious situation. In the last two years, Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine has concentrated our efforts, but it cannot make us forget the Southern Neighbourhood. The serious risk of escalation in the Middle East, the difficulties faced by the countries of the Southern Neighbourhood, or the situation in the Sahel are profound challenges that the European Union cannot ignore. We must act. The agreements with Egypt, or the recent ones with Tunisia and Mauritania, are therefore heading in the right direction. Egypt is a very important neighbour, with significant geostrategic weight. The joint declaration of 17 March, promoted by President Von der Leyen, elevates our partnership with Egypt to a strategic level. This will facilitate political dialogue at the highest level, contribute to strengthening the country's stability, and improve its capacity to face current economic and security threats. Egypt is indeed experiencing a very difficult economic situation, marked by high public debt, elevated inflation, and a severe shortage of foreign currency. I hope that this partnership will contribute to stabilising the country's economy and promoting the necessary structural reforms. This partnership covers other equally important topics — as Vice-President Schinas told us — such as investments in energy, cooperation in the field of migration, or student exchanges — Erasmus+ —, among others. The promotion of democracy, human rights, and fundamental freedoms is also present in the partnership with Egypt. Ladies and gentlemen, Egypt has a great capacity for dialogue with Israel and Palestine. In the current difficult circumstances in the region, Egypt must continue working to achieve a ceasefire and the release of hostages, and to continue facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The European Union cannot aspire to be a global actor if, in its own neighbourhood, it is unable to actively defend its interests and values and act in a cohesive and effective manner. We must contribute decisively to the stability and prosperity of our neighbourhood, which is currently going through a very difficult period.\n",

      "\tMr President, Mr Commissioner, about a month ago, in this very room, as a member of the Committee on Budgets, I openly expressed my opposition to the use of an urgent procedure to make 150 million euros available to Tunisia. We were surprised. In March this year, the process is repeated, now with Egypt, for 7.4 million euros. Loans, investments, and aid for migration-related programmes. All of this without this Parliament exercising its role of democratic scrutiny. The way the European Commission bypassed this Parliament in concluding these agreements is unacceptable. It is inexplicable – and remains unexplained – how agreements of this nature, which must have involved lengthy preparation, do not pass through Parliament? We want to know what conditionalities – beyond the general conditionalities – the Commission established with these agreements with Tunisia and now with Egypt. Was there urgency? We cannot validate these agreements under the argument of urgency, because that is not true. Today we have a new Pact on Asylum and Migration. The European Parliament demonstrated throughout the 9th legislative term that it can act quickly. We did so, for example, in the European response to COVID-19. The European Parliament is the budgetary authority. It does not relinquish its powers, and we cannot think that it is through urgent disbursements that we will become relevant in the Southern Neighbourhood. This is a very limited and very unstrategic view of the problem.\n",

      "\tMr President, Mr Commissioner, honourable colleagues! Egypt has historically long been an important partner for us, the European Union, in the region. And it is right that we conclude comprehensive agreements with such strategic partners, covering all policy areas. However, I find it particularly important to emphasise that it is stipulated that financial support for Egypt is tied to the fulfilment of conditions. The conditions mentioned therein are concrete steps towards effective democratic mechanisms. And it is absolutely right that such conditions exist, honourable colleagues. Unfortunately, in my view, it is not concrete enough as it is written here. One thing is clear: Today, there is virtually no opportunity for civil society in Egypt to express itself openly and critically about the current government. In my view, structural reforms for more human rights and a functioning rule of law are urgently needed in Egypt. And regarding migration management, it must also be absolutely clear, in my view, that human rights are non-negotiable, honourable colleagues. The documented abuses that also occur in Egypt, for example, involving refugees from Sudan, must be investigated and must not form the basis for cooperation between the European Union and Egypt.\n",

      "\tMr President, Mr Commissioner, it seems that Parliament defends human rights a little too much for the Commission. The anomaly is that after two resolutions voted here condemning the actions of the Sisi government, you decided to sign contracts for 7.5 billion. As the standing rapporteur for Egypt in this institution, I have consistently called for strong and precise conditionalities regarding this regime. Through your sleight of hand, Ms von der Leyen ended up receiving a very clear recommendation from the Council. The Council asks you to implement concrete conditionalities in your report to the Sisi regime. If you have no ideas, I will give you some: lift censorship on independent media, release the 60,000 prisoners, stop the pressure on civil society and the opposition, protect sexual equality and the rights of minorities, migrants, and refugees. Today, Mr Commissioner, 18 women were arrested by the Sisi regime because they were demonstrating in front of the United Nations office with a simple petition on the situation in Gaza and Sudan. Where are human rights in this country? Where are the commitments of this regime? After having disregarded Parliament, will Ms von der Leyen also disregard the Council and its recommendations? Stop your hidden agenda. Stop this morbid project which aims to transform the European Union into a World Bank for dictatorships and authoritarian regimes. Finally, live up to our values and principles.\n",

      "\tMr President, Egypt is an essential partner for France and the European Union in Africa. Cairo is currently facing immense challenges. Egypt must strive for food, energy, economic, and financial sovereignty, amidst a particularly degraded neighbourhood. The European Union therefore has everything to gain by standing alongside it. While everyone acknowledges Cairo's decisive role in the pursuit of peace in the Holy Land, Egypt's actions are also beneficial elsewhere, both for its region and for the European Union. In Sudan, Egypt plays an essential humanitarian and diplomatic role, while also hosting refugees from the civil war tearing the country apart. At its Libyan border, Egypt ensures the fight against terrorism, just as it has done for years in the Sinai. While the dark hours of the country's domination by Mohammed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood have barely faded, Cairo has regained its pivotal role in international negotiations. I can therefore only welcome Egypt's participation in the Horizon Europe programme. I hope this progress heralds further advancements, particularly regarding a partnership for migration prevention. This is also an excellent signal for European businesses, which benefit from the new prospects opening up in this territory. France is already at the forefront of projects related to the Cairo Metro, but would benefit from investing more in developing Egyptian markets, such as the construction of the New Cairo city. In Egypt, due to strong demographic pressure, immense construction projects are flourishing, in which our businesses must be supported. As competition rages with Chinese, American, and Arab groups, it is important that European companies play a leading role in the country. At the heart of the emergence of a multipolar world, the European Union must support the intensification of its relations with its historical partners. While this parliamentary term has been marked by several resolutions, which were particularly ill-received by the Egyptian Parliament and numerous associations, I can only express my delight at concluding this final plenary session with good news for our relations with Egypt.\n",

How democratic is it when the European Parliament is merely relegated to the role of a claqueur? Billions of euros are to flow to the military regime in Egypt to keep a useful police state alive. A police state that imprisons dissidents as criminals and is among the leading states in the world when it comes to the death penalty. Democracy and fundamental rights are unscrupulously sacrificed for the sealing off of Europe, well aware that not a single one of these rotten deals, neither the one with Turkey nor with Tunisia and Mauritania, prevents people from coming to Europe, and will continue to cost thousands of lives.\n",

Yet this Commission seems convinced that by paying authoritarian leaders, we can stop people from seeking safety. After the Tunisia deal, the arrivals in Italy did not drop, but the violence, pushbacks and repression in Tunisia increased. It strengthened the dictator Saied and left our allies in society out in the cold. Egyptian dictator el-Sisi is the next in line to receive an EU blank check without any conditions. El—Sisi has effectively destroyed opposition NGOs and critical journalists, and refugees and migrants are being pushed back. Even the Sudanese refugees are being pushed back, attacked and abandoned. This deal will again reinforce everything that the EU should be fighting.

      "\tMr President, Commissioner, Distinguished Members. The Commission and the revamped Team Europe have agreed with Egypt on a joint declaration. This agreement with Egypt is problematic from several perspectives. Firstly, because it is once again merely a press statement and not an international agreement with the EU. The complete disregard for the European Parliament and, not least, its budgetary function, has evidently become standard practice for the Commission. Secondly, this agreement is potentially controversial, as it evidently has no legal force whatsoever, nor does it contain any safeguards regarding the respect for human rights. It is impossible to escape the impression that the Union is once again unconditionally financing an autocrat. Egypt is certainly a strategically extremely important country, also for Europe. But the Commission must cease such practices. We are aware of the challenges that Egypt is facing. And it is only right that Europe also helps its partners. But we must ask ourselves whether Europe is part of the solution or part of the problem. And at whose expense it concludes such agreements and who it might potentially harm. It would be unacceptable for Europe, without adequate safeguards, to contribute in any way to the violation of human rights and the suppression of democracy and the rule of law. Thank you very much.\n",

      "\tMr President, honourable colleagues, 7 billion and 400 million euros. This is the value of the agreement between the European Union and Egypt, concluded in March at al-Sisi's court with Giorgia Meloni, accompanied by Ursula von der Leyen. A full 200 million will be used to halt migrant departures, further externalising the control of European borders and ignoring human rights. This agreement was not only signed bypassing the scrutiny of the European Parliament, but it completely ignores the grave rule of law situation in Egypt. Indeed, cooperation with this country cannot be separated from our demand for human rights to be respected, by guaranteeing freedom of expression, releasing arbitrarily detained persons, and ending the repression of minorities. This was reminded to us just in these days, here in the European Parliament, by the presence of Patrick Zaki, detained for months by the Egyptian regime and now finally free, who told us: \"If I am here, it is because you too, in these chambers, believed that fighting for my freedom was a battle to be won.\" Giulio Regeni's parents also ask this of us, he who died more than eight years ago in Egypt and for whom we are still seeking the truth. A truth that the Egyptian authorities continue to cover up and which the Italian government and European authorities should demand with much greater force. Indeed, yes, fighting for freedom and for truth is a battle to be won. And as Europe, we must continue to do so. Certainly, the European Parliament must prevent this type of commitment from being hampered by agreements lacking monitoring and transparency, carried out by governments in an utterly unacceptable manner.\n",

      "\tMadam President, colleagues, this oral question relates to a budget support measure to Tunisia amounting to EUR 150 million. What is at the heart of the oral question, as I read it, is not Tunisia as such or relations with that country. This oral question addresses a far more principled issue: the relation between the Commission and this House in its role as budgetary authority. It therefore relates primarily to the procedural flaws in drafting and adopting the implementing decision by the Commission. During the drafting phase of the implementing act, not even informal contacts took place between the Commission and Parliament, as stipulated in paragraph 12 of the agreement between Parliament and Commission on comitology procedures. Furthermore, the Commission adopted the draft implementing decision in an urgent procedure after it learned that we were about to initiate an objection. That could even be interpreted as trying to bypass and thereby undermine this House’s authority. Additionally, the special measure seems legally questionable with regard to provisions in the NDICI-Global Europe Regulation, as well as the Financial Regulation on Conditionality. That should not be taken lightly by this House, as it ultimately is about the ability of Parliament to exercise its right of scrutiny that requires proper, timely and sound information by the Commission to Parliament. So we ask whether the Commission can explain why it was necessary to use an urgent written procedure for this special measure last December, given that the budget support of EUR 150 million was announced as early as 11 June 2023, and that an urgent procedure restricts the exercise of Parliament’s powers of scrutiny. Given that a significant deterioration in fundamental rights constitutes grounds for suspending, reducing or cancelling budget support to partner countries, and given the significant deterioration of such rights in Tunisia since July 2021, can the Commission clarify how it has deemed that Tunisia currently meets the requirements? Given that budget support is subject to the provisions of Article 27 of the NDICI-Global Europe Regulation, can the Commission clarify in a written form the definition of conditionality for the said budget support, provide further written details on the procedure and the criteria for assessing whether the conditions are met, as well as on the baseline applied for the assessment of the current state of fundamental rights in Tunisia? Can the Commission clarify why it chose to disburse the budget support in a single tranche, thus not permitting a gradual disbursement based on concrete milestones or steps achieved, as foreseen in Article 236 of the Financial Regulation, nor the suspension of further disbursement should a clear erosion of fundamental rights be observed? Lastly, what formal guarantees has the Commission received from the Tunisian authorities since September 2023 that ensure that Parliament will be allowed to visit EU-funded projects in Tunisia and thus exercise its right of oversight and scrutiny in accordance with Article 14 of the Treaty on European Union.\n",

      "\tMadam President, Commissioner, I am speaking on behalf of the author, Udo Bullmann, rapporteur for the Committee on Development, who is unable to be here. Despite the announcement in June 2023 of the signing of a memorandum of understanding with Tunisia and the inclusion of a €150 million budget support package for macroeconomic reforms, the European Commission only launched the adoption process for this special measure on 20 December 2023, via an urgent written procedure, taking advantage of the Christmas holidays. This procedure raises many concerns for the European Parliament, particularly regarding the issue of migration. The procedure used by the European Commission neglected the role of the European Parliament, as there were no exchanges of information, nor informal or formal consultations, before its adoption, demonstrating a lack of respect for parliamentary scrutiny and the comitology process. We remind the Commission of its obligation to respect conditionality criteria, particularly human rights and the rule of law in Tunisia, as indicated by both the Treaty on European Union and the NDICI—Global Europe Regulation. Given the significant deterioration of fundamental rights in Tunisia since 2021, a detailed assessment of the human rights and fundamental rights situation in that country is necessary to evaluate whether conditions for the effective disbursement of the agreed budget support exist. In this context, the European Parliament cannot ignore the lack of transparency and respect for the oversight power of this institution, nor the inadequacy of the timing and procedures chosen by the Commission to adopt this decision, disregarding the principle of sincere and mutual cooperation between the institutions of the European Union. This special measure cannot set a dangerous precedent. Therefore, Commissioner, we urge the Commission to suspend its implementation. Finally, while the resolution calls for the Commission to provide a series of detailed information in writing, the upcoming high-level geopolitical dialogue will be a timely opportunity to obtain more detailed explanations regarding the timeline and procedure chosen by the European Commission.\n",

      "\tMadam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for explaining these circumstances. Nevertheless, I would venture to remark that even if, according to the Commission, all legal provisions for using this procedure were observed, I believe that consultation and debate with Parliament on the release of such a large sum would be an expression of a certain political culture. I am convinced that if such a large sum as 150 million EUR is being released, at the very least some consultation with the European Parliament should take place. In a democracy, Parliament is the foundation for oversight and control of public funds, public money, and I believe that this should be the case here. I am convinced that the procedure to support Tunisia and provide it with funds in the fight against illegal migration is correct. I personally support providing financial assistance in this way to countries neighbouring the European Union that are somehow burdened by migration. This assistance is necessary, and without it, these countries will not be able to manage these problems in the future. On the other hand, however, I believe we should proceed properly, and for such a sensitive topic, which has a strong political aspect – money earmarked for Tunisia to combat illegal migration and support human rights – I think the procedure should be chosen in a different manner. So, thank you for the explanation, but in the future, I believe a different procedure should be chosen than the one that can be called an urgent written procedure. Thank you, and I hope that in the future the debate will be different and Parliament will be much more involved.\n",

Just before the New Year, the Commission then triggered the payment of 150 million euros, bypassing everything and everyone. Again.

But one thing is also clear: human rights must always be a basis for cooperation. The Commission has just given a fine speech here, but unfortunately did not answer the questions we asked at all. And for me, it is completely clear that the condition for paying 150 million euros to a country where human rights are trampled upon can absolutely not be in the interest of the European Union. Because one thing is clear at this point: we have a president there who not only abolishes democracy, but also immediately arrests the opposition, puts them in prison – without due process. And we're signing a contract with such a person? That surely cannot be true! And I must really say that this procedure via urgent decisions within the Commission, with an alleged examination of the conditions, does not at all meet the standards that we should apply in the European Union, apart from the fact that Parliament, as the budgetary authority, should naturally have been consulted.

We raised an objection to this draft decision in December, but the Commission refused to await the democratic process and pushed through anyhow.

However, formal guarantees must be obtained that this money will indeed be used to finance the announced economic reforms. Furthermore, and above all, we must not be content with this partial implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding. It is also urgent to relaunch the implementation of its pillar concerning the control of emigration towards Italy.

It is also a problem because we cannot exercise our scrutiny role, which is, however, fundamental. It is all the more difficult to understand given that the situation in Tunisia is deteriorating.

That is false: these 150 million had long been earmarked to finance digital, governance, and economic projects. He is paying these 150 million without conditionality, because the conditionalities in this dossier are phantom conditionalities. This goes against the principles of our institution and respect for human rights. He is pushing this through as an emergency procedure under the pretext of the economic crisis in Tunisia. However, by writing this blank cheque of 150 million to Kaïs Saïed, he is financing a dictator and his election campaign, not food or democratic stability in Tunisia.

I am also somewhat disappointed to have negotiated the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument – Global Europe, where we effectively gave the Commission the possibility to resort to emergency procedures, because it had told us that flexibility was needed in this area. So, seeing how flexibility is currently being used by the Commission, well, frankly, as a Member of Parliament who negotiated the NDICI – Global Europe, I truly regret having given the Commission this capacity. Like all my colleagues, I ask for an explanation as to how this decision could have been taken given the utterly disastrous political, economic, and democratic situation in Tunisia, and this, without conditionality – or perhaps with one conditionality: that related to the detention of migrants in Tunisia. This is perhaps what motivated Mr Várhelyi. But when we also see the conditions under which migrants are detained in Tunisia, some of them being sent back to the desert at the Libyan border and thousands of unaccompanied minors being at the mercy of all forms of trafficking, well, I don't think that is a respectable conditionality.\n",

Just one year ago, we were clear with the Resolution adopted, in which we condemned human rights violations, the detention of journalists, and the criminalisation of migrants. However, President von der Leyen, Meloni, and Rutte announced a disbursement of one hundred and fifty million euros. To make matters worse, a memorandum of understanding. With whom? With human rights violators, with those who reject the European Parliament's mission, with those who do not reject sixty million euros in COVID aid? Without consulting this Parliament, the Commission announces the special measure in favour of Tunisia, using an urgent procedure to bypass the opinion of this Parliament. It violates our rules and guarantees, which are the essence of our Union. There are no excuses: if we continue to violate our own rules and procedures, applying a double standard as we did with Tunisia, we will only continue to lose international credibility in foreign policy.

I therefore call for immediate attention to this case and coordinated steps to ensure a proper and fair investigation.\n",

      "\tOn January 1, 2023, we celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia, and thus the establishment of the independent Slovak Republic. I consider this a significant milestone, which, besides celebration, deserves for us to look back and appreciate everything we have achieved in the era of independence. Slovakia gradually became a member of all important international organizations, and in 2004, almost twenty years ago, also of the European Union. Thanks to the work and dedication of a left-wing government, we joined Schengen in 2009 and have also been using the euro since that year. We thus significantly protected our citizens from economic fluctuations, and even today we profit from this common currency more than countries that retained their own currencies. I am pleased that this year Croatia has also joined us in Schengen and the Eurozone, allowing our citizens to travel freely without borders to all seas in Europe. The Slovak Presidency of the European Union in 2016 is still regarded as very successful, which is also a positive. We may not always have the same opinion and stance on the issues we face, but as a country, we have always been a constructive partner in discussions.\n",

      "\tMr President, in Galicia, where I come from, over 7,600 girls and boys lack a paediatrician. In 194 municipalities there is no paediatric service. There is a trend towards centralisation which leaves part of the territory without services. Furthermore, the situation continues to worsen, as more than 25% of active paediatricians are over 63 years old. Paediatric care is an essential service to guarantee the quality of medical care for children and adolescents who require specialised attention. The deterioration of public health in the Spanish State is a fact. Healthcare spending in relation to Gross Domestic Product is below the European Union average, and in Galicia the situation is worse. There are protests for the basic right of our girls and boys to be treated equally to those in other parts of Europe and to have a paediatrician in every municipality.\n",

      "\tMr President, dear colleagues, I am an elected representative from France, more specifically from the Somme department in Picardy, France's leading sugar beet growing region. I wish to stand here, at this rostrum, as the spokesperson for tens of thousands of French farmers, and indeed for an entire sector that risks dying due to a disproportionate decision which, I believe, is totally unsuited to the ecological objective it aims to achieve. The decision by the European Court of Justice to impose the immediate, outright abolition of neonicotinoids on beet growers in Member States is of unprecedented brutality. These insecticides are indispensable for protecting sugar beet crops from aphid attacks. You cannot ignore that the Macron government's decision to impose the European Union's ruling will lead to a proliferation of aphids, a collapse in sugar beet yields and, consequently, the bankruptcy of farms. Instead of giving researchers and farmers time to find an alternative treatment, the French Minister of Agriculture announced that he was yielding to Brussels' demands, which are disastrous for the French sugar beet sector. The French government prefers to abandon farmers in the open country rather than displease its friends in the European Union. You are allowing them to sell even more sugar today, particularly cane sugar from South America.\n",

Its draft for a new cosmetics regulation would overregulate the market for these products. The EU's worldview clashes with reality once again. Bureaucrats find substances that are \"dangerous\". In toothpaste, it's fluoride that's dangerous. In sunscreen, the UV protection is the culprit, and in perfume, it's ethanol that frightens them. But these substances are not dangerous if used in reasonable and small quantities. Take fluoride, for example – it's dangerous to ingest too much fluoride, but in toothpaste, it has been shown to provide very good dental health. Why should such things be restricted? Why do they want to make life more complicated and duller for ordinary people? It's not dangerous to have fresh teeth. It's not dangerous to smell good.

      "\tMr. President, regarding Portugal's GDP growth last year, the highest since 1987, two points. First, this growth is accompanied by the largest fall in the share of wages in GDP during the same period. Real wages have decreased, workers have lost purchasing power, many are becoming poorer while working. Economic groups are increasing their profits, increasing inequalities and injustices. This reality is inseparable from the guidelines, pressures, and impositions of the European Union, to which successive governments have submitted, from attacks on collective bargaining, from public sector wage restrictions, from underinvestment in public services and in the social functions of the State. Second, despite the economic bias of this growth and the exceptional circumstances explaining it, it exposes the absurdity of insisting on debt reduction through budget surpluses and the dictatorship of the deficit. As proven, economic growth is the path to faster and more sustained debt reduction.\n",

      "\tMr President, despite the police having been given free rein, appointees of former Smer governments and their patrons are still protected in Slovakia. The Prosecutor General shamelessly uses Article 363 to quash prosecutions, especially when the accused are friends, family, appointees, sponsors, or fellow party members of former Prime Ministers Fico and Pellegrini. He even used this legal loophole to drop charges against Robert Fico himself and Robert Kaliňák. The scenario is the same every time: just before the investigation findings are submitted to court, the Prosecutor General uses Article 363, and the corruption charges are dropped. The police even produced a video from a hunting lodge, in which Robert Fico himself boasts precisely about his coordination with the Prosecutor General. There are therefore reasonable suspicions that the Prosecutor General abuses this legal loophole in favour of the cronies of Smer and Hlas. Shamelessly, he also fails to see a criminal offence related to the kidnapping of a Vietnamese national, who was brought from Germany to Slovakia and from where he was secretly transported to Russia by government jet. While in Germany, all who cooperated in this kidnapping were convicted, in Slovakia, the Prosecutor General still sees no reason for criminal prosecution. What is a criminal offence in Germany is not a criminal offence in Slovakia.\n",

It was Prime Minister Rutte. On the orders of his D66 Deputy Prime Minister Sigrid Kaag, he still wanted to negotiate.

These two young communists are subjected to physical and psychological torture, beatings, lashings, sleep deprivation and threats of execution. Political repression of communists, peace activists and progressive forces is common in both Ukraine and Russia. If Russians do it, it’s a travesty. Yet, when Ukrainians do it, it is to spread democracy and representing European values. Member States are divided on speeding up accession for Ukraine, and rightly so. The level of corruption is comical. The Zelenskyy government empowers far-right extremists and neo-Nazis while destroying workers’ rights and banning 12 opposition parties – and, as we can see from the case of the Kononovich brothers, are busy persecuting them.

It seems as if cohesion policy is failing in some areas, as if our Just Transition Fund has not functioned as we imagine. Unfortunately, many regions, on the contrary, function like a funnel, like a growth pole, where everyone wants to live. I believe we must address these issues of our cohesion regional policy's failure much better than we have done so far. It is important to make agriculture more attractive; it is important to find attractive, lucrative work and opportunities for many companies in these regions.

Italian anarchist Alfredo Cospito is on his 105th day of hunger strike against the ‘41—bis’ prison regime under which he is incarcerated. It’s a prison regime which authorises the violation of human rights: no phone calls, no parcels, no mixing with other prisoners, 22—hour lockup, one visit a month; a prison regime condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for breaching two of its articles. Yet this regime continues to exist in an EU Member State, unchallenged in our so-called democracies. Alfredo has lost over 40 kilos. His potassium levels have dropped. He will die unless action is taken. The Minister for Justice, who must rule on the revocation by 12 February 12, has said he’s going to leave the decision to the judiciary until 7 March. This is a death sentence. Alfredo doesn’t have that time left. So the question is, will the EU remain silent? This is a human rights issue.

We believe that an immediate special committee of inquiry is absolutely necessary, and that not creating one would be totally incomprehensible, given that this affair is shaking the Parliament as it should, as it is a major scandal.

This criminalisation is a dangerous tendency in Europe, fuelled by the lack of an adequate response by the Commission and the Council.

We could even do a press release together if you would like. But the EPP is always ready to debate migration, because there are plenty of reasons to do so: 330 000 illegal border crossings in 2022, more than 136% increase in the Western Balkans, with over 100 000 asylum applications per month, the highest numbers since 2016. We should debate these alarming numbers, but that is, unfortunately, not the focus of this debate.

      "\tMr President, Commissioner, distinguished colleagues! What is at stake with this advance passenger data? It is about the fact that all of us, when we travel, especially by air, provide data. Data about our name, our date of birth, and similar information, which is then passed on by the airlines to the authorities of the countries we wish to travel to. This is a perfectly normal procedure that exists all over the world. What we are currently discussing here in the European Parliament is: what rules are we actually setting for the processing of this data? Because, distinguished colleagues, for data processing we naturally need rules, because without rules there is no proper data protection.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tWhat the Commission has presented here is a standardisation of these datasets concerning the questions: which data can actually be passed on, how are they passed on, where are they processed, to use the modern term? And eu-LISA was chosen as the external agency for this. I think that's good, because I believe that eu-LISA is a good partner for us in this regard. But it also concerns the question of how other data, the so-called PNR data – how these data, which are partly the same as the API data – how these data flows can be initiated simultaneously.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tFor us as Parliament, it was particularly important that passengers travelling within the European Union could continue to do so without problems. Because there was a fear, or at least we feared, that with the collection of this data, which is to take place automatically, in the future queues would have to be anticipated at airports, or even processes that would prevent people from simply checking in online, then proceeding to boarding, flying to another country and experiencing borderless Europe as we like to experience it. Instead, we feared processes similar to those encountered when travelling to a country that is not part of the Schengen area, and we wanted to prevent that.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tWe have succeeded in this during this debate, because we now have a good compromise before us that also ensures that online boarding remains possible, and that was particularly important to us as Parliament. I would like to say at this point that we have found a good compromise that, for example, also excludes biometric data and ensures a high standard of data protection. And I would like to sincerely thank my co-rapporteur Assita Kanko – because there are two reports we are discussing here; I was responsible for one and Ms. Kanko was responsible for the other – and all shadow rapporteurs. Because that was good, productive work, always focused on the matter at hand. Above all, we succeeded in bringing together the ideas, so to speak, from the perspective of both the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in this House and the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and thus achieving a good result. That is why I am glad that we can conclude this in the current legislative period, and I would then ask for all your support for this report.\n",
      "[ ] 3: Assita Kanko (ECR - (extreme)_right) [2% migration]\n",
      "\tMr President, thank you, colleague Oetjen. I would also like to thank my good colleague Jan-Christoph and all the shadow rapporteurs. I think we made a very effective negotiating team. We found compromises, first within the Parliament and then with the Council, in a very positive atmosphere. And we brought in a lot of good points for Parliament and, more importantly, for our European citizens. I believe that these regulations are going to prove very useful in the fight against terrorism and organised crime. At the moment, 27 Member States and hundreds of airlines use a wide range of separate systems to send passenger data to countries of destination. The passenger data are collected in a self-declaratory manner. Of course, the vast majority of travellers are of goodwill, but the bad guys find ways to abuse the system and travel in and out of the EU undetected. I think that with the solutions we found, we will make life more difficult for criminals and terrorists, but easier for travellers, air carriers and Member State authorities. Now, picking up from my colleague Jan-Christoph, the first point I wanted to mention here is the new Article 5a in API law enforcement on the selection of intra-EU flights. It was not in the Commission proposal, but we made a proposal in the Parliament mandate. The reason is that the European Court of Justice 2 years ago ruled that PNR data may be collected for internal EU flights and shared with law enforcement authorities, but strict limitations will have to apply. The text we have agreed stays fully within the Court ruling on the PNR Directive, whilst offering the Member States and the Commission concrete tools for the implementation of this ruling. I am glad that we could also agree the 12-month deadline for reviews of the assessment. With everything we put in place, we make sure that people’s privacy is protected. The second point worth highlighting here today is that we agreed to move towards mandatory use of the router for PNR data as well. From Parliament’s side, we believed from the start that this would be wise. Most importantly, it will improve privacy oversight. It can truly help with the implementation and supervision of the Court ruling on PNR. It can also lead to a streamlining that is beneficial for air carriers and Member States alike. I think that the phasing approach is the right one, and I would like to thank the Commission for the updated legislative financial statement, which shows the commitment to make the router work also for PNR data starting in 2028. Thirdly, I would like to mention a point that was a bit more difficult for Parliament, namely, what to do in case of technical impossibility to use the router. Throughout the negotiations, Parliament always wanted to stay very closely within the scope of the regulations and avoid any parallel systems. However, we do understand that, in some exceptional cases, Member State authorities may need to ask air carriers for API data via other means if the central system managed by eu-LISA is down. I am glad that the Council accepted our wish to add some extra safeguards, and I trust that with the triple backup of the system, these situations will in any case be extremely rare. Finally, from my side, I would also like to underline our flexibility in accepting the Council’s text on the governance structure. We believe it is a bit unusual to be so specific at the level of the main legislation. However, we also do understand the Council’s desire to give clarity and legal certainty about the various groups and bodies involved in preparing and monitoring the system. Let me take this opportunity to again thank my colleagues, rapporteur Oetjen and the shadows, including Jeroen Lenaers and Tineke Strik, who are present here, and I think we were able to step over all kinds of difficulties from time to time, and we can be proud of the agreement on these important regulations. Of course, I thank all the staff and especially my advisor, Jannes De Jong.\n",

      "\tMr President, this is the last late night debate of this mandate of the European Parliament. So it’s rather fitting that it is dedicated to such an important topic. And I would like to congratulate the co-rapporteurs Assita Kanko and Jan-Christoph Oetjen, for really bringing this important file to a very good and satisfying conclusion. Now, every year, over a billion passengers travel to, from or within the EU. And of course, this is good news because it means that Europe is and remains a very attractive place to be. But it obviously also comes with certain security implications. And we have a duty, all of us together, to make sure that Europe is as safe and secure as possible. We owe this to our citizens. And passenger information, especially when it’s combined with passenger name records, can really be useful to improve border controls, to reduce irregular migration, and to enhance our fight against serious crime and terrorism. And the existing API Directive has already really proven its value in this regard. But there were some elements that needed fixing. The uneven implementation in the Member States, and the fact that there was no mandatory collection of such data, meant that only 65% of incoming flights were actually checked in this way, making it fairly easy for those who wanted to avoid these checks to actually do so. This will no longer be possible. Everybody travelling to the EU will be subject to the same checks, and this is very important, just as it is important that we now can also use API data on intra-EU flights where this is relevant, in order to help our law enforcement authorities to do their job and keep us safe, and fully in line with the way we use PNR for the same data and in line with the Court of Justice ruling. Now, this is really an important element of the EU’s security strategy. It will close the loopholes that we see today and it will have a direct impact on the safety of us all. So I really look forward to its rapid implementation. And once again, thanks to the co-rapporteurs, to the Commission for the excellent proposal, which I agree, we actually managed to strengthen and improve in our negotiations and to all those involved, thank you very much.\n",

      "\tMr President, my group has fundamental concerns about the necessity and proportionality of the mandatory collection of API data, as well as about the transition to automated check-ins only. Still, the text improves the status quo with clear, harmonised European rules on API collection. We also set limits and safeguards. Where Member States now do whatever they want, this revision will shorten the data retention periods and create more safeguards. And finally, after all these years, we bring the collection of API and PNR data in line with the PNR judgment, with clarified selection criteria for intra-EU flights, additional privacy safeguards, and the prohibition of profiling and collecting biometric data. So although API data collection is now mandatory, which we regret, there are also much clearer limits and safeguards. So I would like to thank both rapporteurs, Ms Kanko and Mr Oetjen, for this result and for the good cooperation also with the Commission. And we can conclude this cooperation in the very last voting session of this term, so congratulations for that. Catch-the-eye procedure\n",

The concern of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in participating in this legislative procedure has been, as always, to maintain the European data protection standard, which is the highest in the world, so that the data complies with the principles of proportionality and necessity and its transmission is ensured by a centralised agency, eu-LISA, which guarantees legal compliance in such a sensitive area. The European Parliament, which today holds its last plenary session in this 2019-2024 legislature, has not stopped growing throughout the entire process of supranational integration and, therefore, one can only conclude that the European Parliament continues to grow.

The current update is an improvement on the data rights of all of the passengers coming into Europe. But we cannot look away from the fact that we talk about having legal pathways for legal migrants and asylum seekers. But we have stopped the most effective, safest and modern ways of transport for these people, because we are asking the airlines to stop people that do not have a visa to come into the EU. And you do not get a visa if an embassy, an EU embassy, fears that you will seek asylum. So therefore, with the great work that has been done with adopting the asylum and migration package two weeks ago, we need to make sure that this system that we’ve adopted, which is an improvement on the existing system, does not hinder the protection of refugees across the world.

We have the Greens saying: Yes, we have concerns, but we are implementing the judgment of the European Court of Justice. And we are setting clear rules and strengthening data protection. So, esteemed colleagues, I think this is a good result. And that also shows how European policy can be made: by seeking consensus, incorporating the good points from the various political groups and forging a compromise that can then be supported by all. I believe that this is, in the best sense, what we do here in the European Parliament: we debate the issue, but then we find a result, forge a compromise, and implement it. And if the Member States – who are unfortunately not represented by the Council at this moment, but the Belgian Council Presidency has done a good job, that must also be said at this point – implement it quickly, then the matter will also be properly addressed.

Finally: now that we are entering the election campaign, I hope that we can have a debate about real problems and real solutions. Solutions to finally get asylum and migration under control. Security for everyone, and especially for women. A stop to the excessive regulation of our businesses, certainly also for the hardworking SMEs and much more.

      "\tMr President, I thank Vice-President Schinas for his very comprehensive presentation. The European Union is going through a very serious situation. In the last two years, Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine has concentrated our efforts, but it cannot make us forget the Southern Neighbourhood. The serious risk of escalation in the Middle East, the difficulties faced by the countries of the Southern Neighbourhood, or the situation in the Sahel are profound challenges that the European Union cannot ignore. We must act. The agreements with Egypt, or the recent ones with Tunisia and Mauritania, are therefore heading in the right direction. Egypt is a very important neighbour, with significant geostrategic weight. The joint declaration of 17 March, promoted by President Von der Leyen, elevates our partnership with Egypt to a strategic level. This will facilitate political dialogue at the highest level, contribute to strengthening the country's stability, and improve its capacity to face current economic and security threats. Egypt is indeed experiencing a very difficult economic situation, marked by high public debt, elevated inflation, and a severe shortage of foreign currency. I hope that this partnership will contribute to stabilising the country's economy and promoting the necessary structural reforms. This partnership covers other equally important topics — as Vice-President Schinas told us — such as investments in energy, cooperation in the field of migration, or student exchanges — Erasmus+ —, among others. The promotion of democracy, human rights, and fundamental freedoms is also present in the partnership with Egypt. Ladies and gentlemen, Egypt has a great capacity for dialogue with Israel and Palestine. In the current difficult circumstances in the region, Egypt must continue working to achieve a ceasefire and the release of hostages, and to continue facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The European Union cannot aspire to be a global actor if, in its own neighbourhood, it is unable to actively defend its interests and values and act in a cohesive and effective manner. We must contribute decisively to the stability and prosperity of our neighbourhood, which is currently going through a very difficult period.\n",

We were surprised. In March this year, the process is repeated, now with Egypt, for 7.4 million euros. Loans, investments, and aid for migration-related programmes. All of this without this Parliament exercising its role of democratic scrutiny. The way the European Commission bypassed this Parliament in concluding these agreements is unacceptable. It is inexplicable – and remains unexplained – how agreements of this nature, which must have involved lengthy preparation, do not pass through Parliament? We want to know what conditionalities – beyond the general conditionalities – the Commission established with these agreements with Tunisia and now with Egypt. Was there urgency? We cannot validate these agreements under the argument of urgency, because that is not true. Today we have a new Pact on Asylum and Migration. The European Parliament demonstrated throughout the 9th legislative term that it can act quickly. We did so, for example, in the European response to COVID-19. The European Parliament is the budgetary authority. It does not relinquish its powers, and we cannot think that it is through urgent disbursements that we will become relevant in the Southern Neighbourhood.

And it is right that we conclude comprehensive agreements with such strategic partners, covering all policy areas.

The conditions mentioned therein are concrete steps towards effective democratic mechanisms. And it is absolutely right that such conditions exist, honourable colleagues. Unfortunately, in my view, it is not concrete enough as it is written here. One thing is clear: Today, there is virtually no opportunity for civil society in Egypt to express itself openly and critically about the current government. In my view, structural reforms for more human rights and a functioning rule of law are urgently needed in Egypt. And regarding migration management, it must also be absolutely clear, in my view, that human rights are non-negotiable, honourable colleagues.

Through your sleight of hand, Ms von der Leyen ended up receiving a very clear recommendation from the Council. The Council asks you to implement concrete conditionalities in your report to the Sisi regime. If you have no ideas, I will give you some: lift censorship on independent media, release the 60,000 prisoners, stop the pressure on civil society and the opposition, protect sexual equality and the rights of minorities, migrants, and refugees. Today, Mr Commissioner, 18 women were arrested by the Sisi regime because they were demonstrating in front of the United Nations office with a simple petition on the situation in Gaza and Sudan. Where are human rights in this country? Where are the commitments of this regime? After having disregarded Parliament, will Ms von der Leyen also disregard the Council and its recommendations?

      "\tMr President, Egypt is an essential partner for France and the European Union in Africa. Cairo is currently facing immense challenges. Egypt must strive for food, energy, economic, and financial sovereignty, amidst a particularly degraded neighbourhood. The European Union therefore has everything to gain by standing alongside it. While everyone acknowledges Cairo's decisive role in the pursuit of peace in the Holy Land, Egypt's actions are also beneficial elsewhere, both for its region and for the European Union. In Sudan, Egypt plays an essential humanitarian and diplomatic role, while also hosting refugees from the civil war tearing the country apart. At its Libyan border, Egypt ensures the fight against terrorism, just as it has done for years in the Sinai. While the dark hours of the country's domination by Mohammed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood have barely faded, Cairo has regained its pivotal role in international negotiations. I can therefore only welcome Egypt's participation in the Horizon Europe programme. I hope this progress heralds further advancements, particularly regarding a partnership for migration prevention. This is also an excellent signal for European businesses, which benefit from the new prospects opening up in this territory. France is already at the forefront of projects related to the Cairo Metro, but would benefit from investing more in developing Egyptian markets, such as the construction of the New Cairo city. In Egypt, due to strong demographic pressure, immense construction projects are flourishing, in which our businesses must be supported. As competition rages with Chinese, American, and Arab groups, it is important that European companies play a leading role in the country. At the heart of the emergence of a multipolar world, the European Union must support the intensification of its relations with its historical partners. While this parliamentary term has been marked by several resolutions, which were particularly ill-received by the Egyptian Parliament and numerous associations, I can only express my delight at concluding this final plenary session with good news for our relations with Egypt.\n",

The complete disregard for the European Parliament and, not least, its budgetary function, has evidently become standard practice for the Commission. Secondly, this agreement is potentially controversial, as it evidently has no legal force whatsoever, nor does it contain any safeguards regarding the respect for human rights.

But we must ask ourselves whether Europe is part of the solution or part of the problem. And at whose expense it concludes such agreements and who it might potentially harm.

This agreement was not only signed bypassing the scrutiny of the European Parliament, but it completely ignores the grave rule of law situation in Egypt. Indeed, cooperation with this country cannot be separated from our demand for human rights to be respected, by guaranteeing freedom of expression, releasing arbitrarily detained persons, and ending the repression of minorities. This was reminded to us just in these days, here in the European Parliament, by the presence of Patrick Zaki, detained for months by the Egyptian regime and now finally free, who told us: \"If I am here, it is because you too, in these chambers, believed that fighting for my freedom was a battle to be won.\" Giulio Regeni's parents also ask this of us, he who died more than eight years ago in Egypt and for whom we are still seeking the truth. A truth that the Egyptian authorities continue to cover up and which the Italian government and European authorities should demand with much greater force. Indeed, yes, fighting for freedom and for truth is a battle to be won. And as Europe, we must continue to do so.

And I get it. In Ireland, despite record investment, the housing crisis remains acute, and, far from helping, some EU laws are actually stopping progress. For example, strict EU debt rules forced the government to choose between fiscal prudence and investment in public housing.

      "\tMr President, after the due diligence duty for European companies, the European Parliament will this week discuss a text to combat forced labour. At the same time, in Africa, many accuse the European Union of hypocrisy. For instance, the signing of an agreement with Rwanda for a partnership on rare metals raises the gravest concerns. On 22 February, the announcement of this agreement provoked a reaction from the President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Félix Tshisekedi, who stated, and I quote: \"It's as if the European Union is waging war on us by proxy.\" He also added: \"When you buy a product from a fence, you yourself are guilty of theft.\" No serious international observer explains Rwanda's support for the militias devastating eastern Congo other than by its appetite for the region's mineral resources. It is therefore imperative that this Parliament urgently calls upon the European Commission, so that it finally commits not to fuel one of the worst conflicts in the world by supporting the Kigali regime, which violates and plunders Congo with complete impunity.\n",

This is what makes you today in France, not a righteous person, but one who is pointed out, liable to be summoned before the courts, including for political opposition figures and candidates for the European elections. The overturning of values is complete. It reveals a climate of intellectual and political terror designed to muzzle voices of solidarity with Palestinians and prevent any criticism of Netanyahu's extremist government. Today, in France, the risk is being taken, whatever the cost to democracy, to infringe upon freedom of expression.\n",

More and more mammal species are becoming infected. Humans, too, are ultimately mammals. The WHO therefore warns that this animal pandemic could also spill over to humans. I call on the Commission and the Member States for more and prompt research from a \"One Health\" perspective: for example, is the virus already present among European cows, goats, and pigs? How does it spread? I ask for more attention to vaccine development for humans and animals, and as many unnecessary barriers as possible must be removed to enable vaccination.

Inequalities continue to rise, and 95 million Europeans live in poverty or at risk of social exclusion. And just like 100 years ago, populisms proliferate, feeding on fear and insecurity about the future. But there is time to reverse this course. There is time, because there is hope. This is not the time to give up. It is not the time for the politics of interests, nor for interests in politics. It is time to fight, to fight for a fairer economic system that combats inequalities, to fight for sustainability and the future of generations to come, to fight for a democracy that guarantees and respects our fundamental rights, allowing each person to find the space to realise their dreams, to fight for a dream of community in which we care for others and in which each of us is free to be who we are, because we are only truly free when all of us are free.

      "\tMr President, dear colleagues, I would like to draw your attention to the situation concerning the Estonian congregation of the Russian Orthodox Church. This is the largest religious congregation in Estonia, comprising more than 100 000 believers. We all know that the Head of the Russian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate supported Russia’s war against Ukraine and called it the ‘Holy War’, which is absolutely disgusting and condemnable. And this is exactly what the Estonian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate did: it officially condemned this idea of holy war. But unfortunately, this is not enough for the Estonian authorities. They continue to insist that the words of the Moscow Patriarchate cast a shadow of terrorism on the Estonian Orthodox believers, and seem to want to legally dissolve the Estonian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. The EU is based on the principle of protection of freedom of religion and belief, and we should not interfere in religious and ecumenical matters. I hope that it will not eventually be done in Estonia, and that is the reason I do bring this extremely sensitive issue to your attention. This is kind of an early warning, and I want to hope an unnecessary one, but we’ll see tomorrow.\n",

Our parents and grandparents once signed up for a common market, but gradually received an overbearing political Union with flags, anthems, common debts, and now even moving towards its own army, while the voter never asked for or voted for that. It is therefore not surprising that the European elections in the Netherlands traditionally have the lowest turnout. Meanwhile, people are asking themselves: what is the point, really? But history teaches us one thing: political collaborations like the European Union do not survive if they rigidly keep moving in one and the same direction. They must change, adapt, or they die out. In Europe, the time has now come. The flow of power from the Member States to Brussels must be reversed. We must let power and resources flow back. Back from Brussels to the Member States and – even more importantly – back to the Dutch people.\n",

In Italy alone, every year we count 2,000 officers injured at the hands of illegal immigrants, antagonists, and street thugs; five per day, amidst the indifference of the left, which would even disarm the police and views uniforms with annoyance. In recent months, a shameful and dangerous anti-police hatred has grown, because it legitimises street clashes by social centres. At Sapienza University in Rome last week, there were clashes with the police; a police station was even attacked. The left preferred to defend the violent, clinging to the right to protest. I am and always will be on the side of those who every day wear a uniform to guarantee public order and security, never on the side of criminals who, with any excuse and political cover, feel legitimate in attacking law enforcement.

      "\tMr. President, we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the April Revolution in Portugal. The fascist dictatorship was repression, imprisonments, torture, and assassinations. It was economic and social backwardness, illiteracy and obscurantism, misery, inequality, injustice, emigration. It was a denial of rights for workers, women, and young people. It was colonialism and colonial war with NATO's support. It was corruption and the concentration of wealth in a handful of monopolies. The April Revolution, the achievement of the progressive captains and the Portuguese people, was national sovereignty, freedom, peace, democracy. It brought rights at work, health, education, social security, housing, and culture. It was the nationalisation of the strategic sectors of the economy. It was agrarian reform in the latifundia zone, it was friendship and cooperation with all peoples of the world. Fifty years later, many of the achievements were destroyed and curtailed by decades of right-wing policies. Others persist, as a result of the struggle of workers and the people, showing that the future of Portugal lies in the values that April achieved. That is why, last week, we brought a taste of the celebration that April was to the European Parliament. Fifty years ago, the Portuguese people commanded, and April was made.\n",

The Union has fundamentally improved the quality of life of its citizens, helps in disasters, assists in resolving conflicts, supports science, innovation, young people like no other international organization in the world, reduces disparities between regions, and supports good projects of municipalities, small and medium-sized enterprises. There is undoubtedly room for improvement and also for change within our Union. The Union faces immense geopolitical challenges. Nature protection is literally vanishing before our eyes. We must reduce bureaucracy and distinguish between what is essential and what is not. A great deal is truly at stake in the upcoming European elections.

The European Union responded to challenges and also responded to Europeans who demanded more action in Europe, in Health. And thus, the European Health Union was born. A dream, a project, a reality still under construction. And the European Health Data Space will be a new and revolutionary fundamental pillar of this construction. This regulation will allow a Madeiran traveling to the mainland or even to another country in the European Union and needing to use health services greater access to healthcare. Doctors will have access to their health record immediately, without delays, without having to request repeated tests in their own language. This is estimated to save about 20% of healthcare spending. We have worked, here, to ensure that no European, living in Madeira, on the mainland or in any other Member State, is left behind and, on behalf of Parliament, I proudly say: mission accomplished.\n",

This week we finally received good news from the US Congress, which decided on support for Ukraine amounting to 61 billion dollars. This is a clear signal to the whole world, but also to us, the European Union, because it is us that Ukraine has been urgently asking in recent weeks to send air defense systems to Ukraine. That is also why we called on the European Council to do so immediately, and as long as member states do not send this aid to Ukraine, the European Parliament will not approve the discharge. Unfortunately, last week the European Council has not yet decided, nor have the foreign ministers today. I appreciate that Germany has joined this initiative. But there are other European countries that have these systems, and no one understands why they are still waiting, what they are waiting for.

Due to the inflated costs of construction materials used, the immense salaries of the county water company's management, and the politicisation of its management, it has led to a situation where in the beautiful Alba County, which has many water resources, prices for the population are higher than in big cities, where incomes are much higher. I decided to speak about these matters in the plenary of the European Parliament because local politicians wrongly blame the European Union, even though I have presented concrete solutions to all these problems, from the digitalisation of the company to the creation of a solidarity fund facilitated by European Union legislation. These things are happening in a context where the works carried out are of poor quality, the water contains impurities that make it undrinkable, and the rivers in the county are victims of polluters protected by the local mafia. To this end, I have addressed a request to the European Commission to verify these aspects and to restore the right to quality water for the people of Alba.\n",

Israel bombed an embassy in a third country, and the Brits and the US and France, they blocked condemnation of this crime at the UN Security Council. Von der Leyen gave the diplomatic cover for Israel’s genocide in Gaza, while the US, Britain, Germany and France provide the arms, logistics and support for the crime of crimes. European powers are still perpetrating genocide in the 21st century. The mask is gone. All the propaganda about civilisation, international law and EU values, it’s all been exposed.
