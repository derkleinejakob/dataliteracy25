      "\tMr President, honourable Members, Europe's migration policy of recent years is untenable. We are witnessing systematic human rights violations at our borders, pushbacks that often go unpunished, and a Dublin system that works neither for the Member States nor for those seeking protection. Therefore, it is clear: in this parliamentary term, Europe finally needs effective solutions for migration and asylum, clear rules for control and solidarity based on our values of democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights, including the right to asylum in Europe. The reform of the Common European Asylum System can contribute to this, but it is also just one piece of the puzzle for a comprehensive migration policy. What is currently missing includes a stronger role for municipalities and civil society, cooperation with countries of origin on an equal footing, without outsourcing our humanitarian responsibility, and not least, simpler and expanded possibilities for legal entry into the EU, also to address our economy's growing need for workers. Only if we tackle these challenges will we succeed in shaping migration sustainably and in the interest of all involved parties in the future. So, much work lies ahead of us in the coming years.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tToday, however, we are discussing the present legislative package, which includes proposals that can only now be concluded after eight years. That we had to wait so long for a reform due to the blockade by the Member States is shameful. Also shameful are the circumstances in which negotiations with the Council took place: instead of a contractually stipulated loyal cooperation between the institutions, there was a Council that refused many compromises, often without clear arguments. Therefore, we are not voting today on a perfect legislative package – it is not even a very good one – and I will not conceal points of criticism: mandatory border procedures without exception for families, inadmissibility decisions for supposedly safe third countries, and instrumentalisation are highly problematic elements, the necessity of which the Council could not even explain. This must be particularly critically monitored during implementation. In my report, the screening, we also had to make concessions – for example, the screening of persons already present in the territory. Here, there are even considerable doubts as to whether the existing legal basis permits this measure.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tNevertheless, the package also contains positive elements: in the screening, for example, important protection measures and uniform standards, or a significantly strengthened, independent fundamental rights monitoring mechanism, which is also extended to the border procedures. Furthermore, solidarity-based cooperation among Member States will become mandatory for the first time – this is an important first step towards shared responsibility – and a resettlement framework will also be introduced. In addition to an individual assessment of the various texts, the overall picture is also important for our decision, and this shows: after years of deadlock in the Council, we have finally succeeded in reaching an agreement on asylum reform. This will enable us to ensure that European law is upheld everywhere in Europe and that Member States, having approved this by qualified majority, also implement it. We also expect the Commission to resume its role as guardian of the Treaties, a role it has neglected or even ignored for far too long, especially under Commission President von der Leyen.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tOur commitment to a solidarity-based and progressive migration policy does not end today. Rather, in addition to the missing elements mentioned at the outset, one of our core tasks in the coming legislative term will be to monitor that the new law is fully implemented – in all Member States and, yes, respecting our fundamental rights, including the right to asylum. Then this reform, too, can be a step in the right direction.\n",

      "\tMr President, Madam Commissioner, dear Ylva Johansson, dear colleagues, we are at a moment of truth. After three and a half years of complex and demanding work, and almost ten years after the Syrian refugee migration crisis, we face a crucial vote to finally reform the European asylum and migration system. This pact is a coherent, complementary set of texts to finally address the migratory challenge, as Europeans. Together, we champion four priority objectives. The first: to ensure strategic steering of European asylum policy among the 27 Member States, with a prominent role for the Commission in coordination and monitoring. The second element: an unprecedented solidarity mechanism at European level to assist Member States in the event of migratory pressure or crisis. The third pillar: to establish better control of irregular immigration at the external borders of the European Union, thanks to accelerated border procedures for applicants manifestly ineligible for asylum. Finally, to implement more harmonised, more effective asylum procedures within the European Union, accompanied by essential rights for minors, for families, and for all asylum seekers. These various legislative instruments will enable the European Union to be better prepared to respond to the main challenges of immigration. This pact will not solve everything, but it is a step forward, a giant leap towards real control and sound, humane management of immigration in France, in Europe, and on our continent. Nor is this the end of the road. We will have to put all our energy, as my colleague Birgit Sippel has just reminded us, into ensuring the implementation and respect of the new rules in all countries of the Union. With my Renew group, we will follow this implementation with extreme vigilance and we count, Madam Commissioner, on the European Commission to fully play its role as guardian of the treaties. Indeed, we have already started working on measures, particularly for families. Dear colleagues, we face our responsibilities: to vote against the pact, offering a victory to the European far right which has done everything to obstruct the development of solutions to migratory challenges (in our country, France, for example, it is the Rassemblement National that does not want solutions, cynically feeding off problems); or to vote for this pact responsibly. Dear elected colleagues from centrist and pro-European parties, I call on you to support this pact. Our fellow citizens want action, not grand speeches.\n",
      "[x] 4: Tomas Tobé (PPE - christian_conservative) [39% migration]\n",
      "\tMr President, Commissioners, today, we have an historic opportunity to finally put in place a common European migration policy. After migration crisis after migration crisis, after political failure after political failure, we can finally deliver to the European citizens. Most of us understand that if we have a common external border, we also need more common migration policy. The EPP Group will support the migration pact. We think that it is crucial that we start to take back control from the smugglers, because we need to decide who will actually enter the European Union. We need to strengthen our common border, because only so can we also ensure that we move towards a policy when we can give protection to those in need and not to irregular migrants. We also, in the migration pact, finally acknowledge that we need to cooperate also with third countries if we want to manage migration in a better way in the future. Finally, and perhaps even more important: in the migration pact, we make it clear that we need to cooperate better within the Union. It cannot be so that this comes to responsibility for a few Member States, where we try to find different ad hoc solutions. Now we make it clear that it is a responsibility for everyone to contribute. This is basically about building trust: building trust between the Member States, but also building trust from the citizens that the European politicians actually can deliver also when it comes to migration. Yes, the negotiations have been long – and let’s be honest, they have been hard, even within this House and together with the Council. But from the EPP Group, I would like to thank for the cooperation with the S&D Group and the Renew Group, and also with some responsible delegations in the ECR Group. But I still hear many colleagues in this House now that are ready to do whatever it takes to stop the migration pact. And I would like to turn to The Left Group and the Greens Group. You very often give speeches about the far right, but the truth is today you want to stop the migration pact together with Le Pen and AfD. That is the truth. You should instead vote in favour of the migration pact because then we could put a stop to the horrific numbers of deaths on the Mediterranean Sea. Don’t leave this in the hands of the smugglers. Colleagues, today we have an opportunity to send a clear message: Europe can agree also on divisive issues. Let’s move away from the political deadlock. Let’s move forward to a migration policy that actually works for everyone and that will, for certain, work better than what we have today. Vote in favour of the migration pact. Vote in favour for Europe.\n",
      "[x] 5: Juan Fernando López Aguilar (PSE/S&D - social_democratic) [45% migration]\n",
      "\tMr. President, Mr. Vice-President, Madam Commissioner, Members of the European Parliament, today we are undertaking a decisive, indeed a defining, vote, not only looking at the past and present of the European Parliament, but, above all, looking towards the future. Because it is, to begin with, about fulfilling a mandate of European Law, of the Treaty of Lisbon and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union: that there be a common migration system, with a common European migration policy and legislation, and a common asylum system, with an asylum policy and legislation that provide added value to the unilateral, fragmented, and insufficient solutions of the Member States, which we have described as unsustainable, as well as unjust. It is about, therefore, finally bringing European law into force, and doing so, moreover, with respect for our values and by providing a joint approach to the five Regulations, which are five directly binding laws. One of them is the Regulation on crisis situations, which is not the ordinary response, but the response to situations in which a Member State declares itself overwhelmed by a massive or quantitatively very significant, very impactful arrival of irregular migrants, especially after search and rescue operations, also at regional and island scales. This therefore requires an articulated European solidarity mechanism, a European response cushion, a European solidarity that involves the Commission with an implementing act and also the Council through the Commission's Recommendation to elevate its offers of solidarity to all Member States, either through orderly relocation programs, finally coordinated by a European coordinator, or through contributions to the Asylum and Migration Fund, which help Member States to equip themselves to offer an adequate response to these emergency situations. It is about, therefore, finally enacting predictable European legislation with legal certainty in areas where there has only been action-reaction until now. It is also about doing so with common guarantees, in particular through the protection of people in the most vulnerable situations, such as women, women with dependent children, unaccompanied minors and, of course, victims of trafficking. These situations require differentiated treatment, and that is what we have fought hard for in the negotiation with this Council. Of course, we are aware that this issue has not been easy. In fact, it has been the most divisive and thorny issue on the European agenda for too long. Therefore, the negotiation has not been easy in this European Parliament, and certainly it has not been easy with the 27 interior ministries, which is the Council with which we have addressed the final phase. It must be said that in every negotiation concessions must be made and the result has limitations. But the result, if it offers legal certainty and guarantees, is always better than no result at all. Of course, it is better than leaving things as they are. It is better than abandoning the governments of the Member States to their fate. It is better than sending the message that, every time there is an emergency migration situation in island situations such as in the Canary Islands, Lampedusa, or the Greek islands, the response simply has to be strictly national and no solidarity can be expected from the European Union. No, that cannot be the future of the European Union, nor can it be the message for the elections on June 9th. The message must be that we have done everything in our power. Have we done everything? No. It remains, of course, to fulfil our own mandate to establish a coordinated European search and rescue mechanism, and to jointly and effectively fight against criminal organizations that traffic and exploit people, as well as to continue opening legal and safe pathways that give an opportunity to people fleeing desperation to reach Europe without risking their lives in the attempt or tragically losing them, as has been happening for too long. The two options are clear: either rules are established with guarantees, with all the limits and all the criticisms that one specific point or another may have raised, which is inevitable in such a complex negotiation, or Member States are simply abandoned to their fate. The situation could worsen even further if, after all the accumulated work and all the energy and time we have consumed on this, the message were that we have not succeeded, because much worse than the situation as it is—which is already unbearable—is to have tried and failed. Taking a step forward, with all its limitations and also with guarantees, is within our reach if we vote in favor of each of the Regulations, of the European laws that make up this pact.\n",

      "\tThank you, Mr. President! The Left is deeply critical of the agreement being debated and voted on today. Hundreds of NGOs and organisations working on refugee solidarity, life-saving, and support for people seeking protection here in Europe have been very clear: we MEPs should say no to this agreement. Today's vote, which we will have later this evening, does not solve the problems it is supposed to solve. There will be no automatic redistribution of those seeking protection; instead, the first country of arrival remains responsible. There will be no real solidarity. Nothing, absolutely nothing, is being done to stop the deaths in the Mediterranean. On the contrary. The increasingly closed borders will lead to more brutality, increasingly dangerous routes, and greater risks. Instead, we get more of what doesn't work, and I wish more of you had been there to see what it looks like at the EU's borders. We will see more systematic detention, imprisonment of people at the EU's borders with the dehumanisation that entails. We will see more violence and degradation, and believe me, there is already a lot of that brutality even now. We will see deterrence and confinement. We will see more cooperation with dictatorships and despots. It started with Turkey, as you surely remember. But now we are here. The so-called Libyan coast guard, which consists of militias that force people back to torture and violence. We are going to cooperate with Tunisia, Egypt. All to stop people on the run. One of the most serious problems with this agreement is that the individual right to asylum is being attacked. It is being undermined in a terrible way, as EU countries will say that you and you and you came from a so-called safe third country and you will not even have your protection grounds examined. That is to say, we will not even assess your protection grounds. That is, de facto, rendering the right to asylum null and void. And some of you, far too many here, say that nothing else could have been achieved. We've heard that before, haven't we? It's called TINA – There Is No Alternative. But why engage in politics if you are here to dystopically follow in the footsteps of the far-right and right-wing nationalism? That is certainly not the path of the Left. All of us, and I mean all of us here from all political families, know that we can do so much better. And we have shown it. When Putin's bombs fall on Ukrainian citizens, then we ensure protection for those who must flee. That is the path we should have chosen. That is still the path we should choose. Not this brutal, dehumanising way. There is one proposal that stands out in today's package, and that is the Left's proposal, which we have worked on, and for which I have been the rapporteur. It concerns a European quota refugee system. It concerns a humanitarian system. There, we provide protection, a safe path for people, the most vulnerable refugees. We cooperate with the UN, with UNHCR. We ensure that we provide support and aid, that we support those countries that receive a great many refugees, often millions. That is what we do in the Left. We roll up our sleeves when the rest of your political families want to close borders, increase brutality, and abolish the right to asylum. But then, we in the Left open legal, safe migration routes. This system for quota refugees is not obligatory for member states to participate in. But it is a way for people to reach safety and security to seek protection here in Europe. I am proud of that. I hope that every single member state takes this chance to offer protection to people seeking it here in Europe. And I promise you, that is the Europe the citizens want to see. They do not want to be part of a dystopian Europe where the only choice is to trudge along with the nationalist right. We know we can do so much better than that. So make sure to vote in the Left and humanitarian forces into this Parliament when you get the chance in June.\n",

      "\tEurope is at a crossroads. Migration and asylum policy are among the most divisive issues for our citizens and for politics in general, and often a means of manipulation, extortion, and excuses. We have felt the consequences everywhere, including in the Schengen area. Reform of the entire field of migration was essential. In the long run, the survival of the Union as such also depends on it. So, after eight years of blockades and several attempts, we have succeeded. Later, we will vote on the entire package of renewed migration and asylum legislation. With these, Europe enters a new era. What we have on the table is not a perfect solution; it is a compromise. However, reform is a strategic necessity that we in the European Parliament are adopting with a heavy heart. But we are not shying away from our responsibility. This is what European citizens, above all, expect from us. I myself was the rapporteur for the reform of the Qualification Regulation. The bulk of the text was already agreed in 2018, but Europe and the world were different then. I am convinced that such a text would no longer be possible to adopt today, given the current circumstances in the EU. So, the proposed Qualification Regulation was part of the first unsuccessful asylum policy reform in 2016. The regulation will replace the existing Qualification Directive and sets out in one place the standards regarding the conditions for obtaining international protection in the Union – either refugee status or subsidiary protection status – and, on the other hand, the rights of beneficiaries in the event of a positive decision. This regulation is, therefore, a key component of the future European asylum system and will ensure equal treatment of applications across Europe. This will help deter 'asylum shopping' and thereby indirectly reduce the phenomenon of secondary migration. Until now, the application of the directive has been very arbitrary among countries. They had to implement the directive into national law and also enforce it. However, there were significant variations and deviations in this process. We know of cases where, for example, an applicant for international protection from Afghanistan had virtually no chance of a positive decision in one Member State, while having an almost one hundred percent chance in another Member State. Let us hope, therefore, that such stories will be a thing of the past and that Europe will truly come alive in this area too. Allow me now to focus on the main substantive highlights. Among the main achievements of the Qualification Regulation, I certainly count the uniform minimum length of residence permits. This will be valid for at least 3 years for refugee status, and for subsidiary protection status, a minimum of one year, followed by a minimum of two years upon renewal. Status review will not be automatic and mandatory. Indeed, the beneficiary's status is maintained as long as there is a need for their protection. I am particularly proud of this success. We also succeeded in broadening the definition of family for the purposes of the regulation. A novelty of the regulation is the assessment of the availability of internal protection. Thanks to this House, we have significantly limited the application of this principle. This will only be mandatory in cases where the persecution of the applicant is not carried out by the state. Refugees will also receive greater protection due to the faster issuance of residence permits. These must also be free of charge. Henceforth, the period of residence that counts towards obtaining a permanent residence permit will be calculated from the date of application, and not, as before, only half the time from application to recognition of protection. The processing of applications can, in some cases, take more than a year, which is why this change is more than important, it is extremely important. Furthermore, beneficiaries will be treated equally with citizens of the host country regarding rights such as social and healthcare, rights concerning access to work, and, of course, education. Moreover, unaccompanied minors, who are a particularly vulnerable category, will now be entitled to greater protection and safeguards. In this case too, I am proud of the European Parliament's success. Esteemed colleagues, hoping for a favourable outcome, I thank you for your cooperation and attention.\n",

      "\tMr President, Commissioner, colleagues, big majority of Europeans want a humane and controlled European migration policy, and that is why we have to end years of chaos and inhumane circumstances, because we will not be able to explain to our voters that we end this term in chaos. We’ve witnessed in recent years the total collapse of trust between the Member States. We’ve seen pushbacks and violence at the external borders, inhumane reception conditions and asylum seekers sleeping on the streets of the richest countries on this planet. Over the past eight years, we’ve worked tirelessly for a package that is in line with our values, while the political climate is getting chillier by the day. Compromises have been reached just before Christmas with great difficulty, and I find it tragic that this House found itself defending European values against the Council because, regretfully, many governments are not upholding those same values, and they will aim to deny as many asylum claims as possible and put as many people in indefinite detention as they can, including children. That is why the European Commission needs to be tough and enforce the law that we’re going to vote today. The European Commission will have to do a lot more to convince us that it will actually enforce the new pact, because in recent years it allowed human rights violations to happen and it didn’t lift a finger, I’m sorry to say. Dirty deals with Tunisia, colleagues, cannot be considered a confidence-building measure either, for that matter. But this House also has a responsibility. We will have to hold the European Commission to account, and we have not done so for the last five years. If we’re criticising the Commission – and I am criticising the Commission – we also have to acknowledge that we let the Commission get away with it for the past five years and we didn’t lift a finger. Today in the vote, the far right will be showing its true colours. It will vote against because it doesn’t really want solutions. It wants chaos and misery to continue because that’s what they feed on. There are also colleagues who will vote against for understandable and legitimate reasons, and I share many of their concerns. But I still think that we should endorse the package because we have a responsibility as politicians – because if we reject the pact, there will be nothing in its place. There’s not going to be a better alternative, but we’ll end up with a situation where no single rule will be respected anymore and we’ll end in a race to the bottom and the end to the right of asylum in Europe. We cannot, unfortunately, legislate away an ultra-right majority because even if you reject the package, that majority will still be there and it may actually be bigger in the next term. And are you going to entrust the next Parliament with the elaboration of our asylum policies? Well, not me, colleagues, not me. With regard to my own file – the Reception Conditions Directive – we’ve obtained many guarantees and safeguards for asylum seekers, especially for the most vulnerable. We have ensured a legal representative for all unaccompanied children from the day they arrive. We made sure that the detention of children is the absolute exception and only with judicial authorisation. We’ve guaranteed asylum seekers access to education and language courses and quicker access to the labour market. We ensured specific attention for vulnerable groups like women, children and LGBTIQ people, and the standards laid down in the Reception Conditions Directive will apply to the entire package, and upholding all of these elements in the implementation of the pact is crucial, because it can only work if it has the trust of everyone. The weakness lies not in the legal text, colleagues, that is quite clear. It lies in the implementation by the Member States and enforcement by the European Commission. So today we need to prove the cynics wrong and show that asylum is a European matter requiring a European response in line with our European values – and we take responsibility.\n",

      "\tMr./Madam President, today we are voting on a fundamental revision of European asylum policy. Nine years after the 2015 crisis, a plan is finally on the table that puts an end to the chaos and suffering at our external borders. This plan entails strict screening and reception at those external borders, distinguishing between genuine refugees and migrants from safe countries, with mandatory border procedures and return for the latter group, and more solidarity within Europe. In other words: with this Migration Pact, we are finally gaining control over migration. Finally, it will no longer be human traffickers but the Member States that determine who gains access to the EU. Of course, a compromise like this is rarely perfect. Not all challenges will be solved as if by magic. But it is a very important first step on which we must build further. Let us not delude ourselves. A vote against this Pact is not a vote for better policy. No, a vote against is a vote for maintaining the current situation, for years more of high influxes of illegal migration, for overcrowded reception centres and a lack of control at the external borders, for the business model of human traffickers and their life-threatening routes. A vote against today is a vote for the status quo. That is where the far-left – and I include the Greens in that – and the far-right are trying to find common ground today. Horseshoe theory in its purest form. A dark coalition between Frans Timmermans and Geert Wilders, while people across Europe have been concerned about migration for years and rightly expect the European Union to act. That is a colossal responsibility for all of us here in this chamber today. Let us not shirk that responsibility.\n",

And it is perhaps truly one of the most important decisions we will take in this legislative term – and it is certainly also one of the hardest for many. But in fact, European citizens are currently looking at us and seeing whether, after years of blockages and negotiations, we manage to truly get to grips with this. And does the Pact solve all problems? No. Is it better than the status quo? Yes, and many have already pointed that out. And I know that this Pact also contains points that are painful, and I too feel that, for example, when I see that families with small children are not particularly protected in border procedures. But nothing else was possible with the Member States. And if Europe is not able to act in this area, which is a core area because it can only be resolved at a European level, then that only fuels the right-wingers, those who seek to divide, those who want chaos and who are banking on Europe being incapable of action.

This is a historic moment because for a long time we have been trying to work towards European solutions when it comes to migration. I understand the various individual interests. I understand the emotions, but these always block the solutions. So it is about responsibility. In my opinion, all those who negotiated have shown their responsibility. But everything also depends on the people who may not have been so closely involved in the negotiations on the legislation. It is your responsibility to vote. If you vote against, you vote for maintaining the current situation: a major humanitarian drama, no control over migration. So only by working together and making your voice heard for this Pact, do we take a step forward. It is not ideal. It can always be better in various respects, but we are taking a step forward.

This pact offers no solution to better manage arrivals, to end deaths in the Mediterranean, human trafficking, reception crises in our Member States, violations of fundamental rights, or the right to asylum. The pact, on the contrary, seals this Fortress Europe in its texts and its collaboration with dictatorships.

On the one hand, too many deaths at sea, the huge business of human trafficking, the pro-immigration political battle of NGO ships, lauded and rewarded in this Chamber, despite representing the link with human smugglers. On the other hand, the loss of security in our cities, the increase in undeclared work with the consequent compression of workers' rights, the hateful exploitation of women, the spread of Islamic radicalism with its most violent manifestations. Improving the current situation: this is the only reason to vote in favour of some of the regulations in the new Pact. A few steps in the right direction, few but important, with the hope of continuing on this path with greater resolve during the next European legislature. Departures must be stopped by collaborating with the migrants' countries of origin and transit, establishing first who has the right to enter Europe and who does not. This is the only possible structural solution, also by helping developing nations to remove the causes of emigration. This is what we have been trying for years to make the left understand, that they would like to let everyone in, indiscriminately, and then give them the right to vote and thus supplant the will of our populations. The 71% decrease in landings in Italy and the drastic reduction in deaths at sea confirm the effectiveness of the Meloni government's choice to prevent arrivals, working patiently and with determination on the external dimension of European borders.

It is, in reality, submersion or punishment. Our countries will be forced to host thousands of migrants in their towns and villages, or else pay, and pay dearly, to be spared.

We will therefore oppose this pact of submersion, with its incessant pull factors, with the brutality by which you inflict upon the peoples migratory waves that they no longer desire.

No common policy, instead five more years of stopgap solution after stopgap solution. We have wrestled in this House, we have argued, we have debated, we have listened and explored, we have repeatedly pulled things back together. We were so often deadlocked, we left negotiating rooms, and precisely when things got difficult, we kept searching for the delicate balance that the Pact ultimately entails. That is the strength of this House, which is capable of so much more than it sometimes shows. Today we stand here and decide whether all these efforts, all these debates, have been worthwhile, whether they were right or in vain.

It is about no longer ceding control to criminal networks and traffickers over who comes to us and who does not. It is about correcting the mistakes of 2019.

We are indeed willing to take responsibility for an asylum policy. But it must be an asylum policy that works and that does not capitulate to right-wing sentiment, but rather considers pragmatic solutions based on the rule of law, human rights, and solidarity.

The Lega delegation has, during these years of work, called for preventing departures by defending borders without having to risk prison, as is happening today to Minister Salvini; for establishing identification centres in transit countries managed by European agencies; and for strengthening cooperation agreements to facilitate repatriations. These are common sense proposals aimed at stopping that criminal business which you are well aware of and even facilitate. But the Pact on the table today, with the exception of very few useful provisions, fails to achieve any objective. It is a compromise at all costs, in search of a majority but offering neither solutions nor protections. There is no protection for the desperate people crossing the desert, as they will remain at the mercy of criminals. There is no protection in our territories, lands now conquered and subject to the danger of terrorism. There is no protection for European society and culture from those who think, with your complicity, that they can subjugate it. You shamelessly repeat that cheap labour is needed, and if this is the only reason – we want to believe it – have the dignity to legally co-opt them. You will find us on the barricades, because for us, whoever arrives in Europe must do so legally to be integrated into our civilization and not become either a slave or a criminal. This is not the Europe we want, but we will build it with courage, consistency, common sense, and without ideology.\n",

      "\tThis pact is a pact of shame, because the individual right to asylum is abolished, and what remains is a right that does not make individual reasons for flight the standard, but rather the lie of safe third countries, some asylum recognition quotas, or the neurotic assumption of the instrumentalization of migration. The Council and the majority of this House do nothing against the dying at sea at our borders; the construction of new border fences is much more important to them. They vote for border procedures in which even families with infants are imprisoned. They vote for there to be no binding reception criteria for refugees. But what they cannot vote away is the resistance against this policy. Empathy and humanity cannot even be struck down with an axe. Sea rescuers, activists, NGOs do not stop helping refugees, just as the Turkish Muslim woman in Edirne who daily provides refugees with food – to this day. Let me conclude with a Catholic priest whom I met in Iraq in 2015, in the middle of the war, when the terrorist organization Daesh killed and abducted thousands of people and this priest opened his church to refugees, regardless of their religion. He said to us: \"There are the military positions of Daesh, and here is my church. I don't know what will happen tomorrow, whether we will be attacked, but I will stay, because I cannot do otherwise.\"\n",

After more than a decade of deadlock, the European Union has reached an agreement on the Pact on Migration and Asylum, or I hope it can be achieved. The timing could not be more opportune, as last year's figures bring us closer to a crisis similar to that of 2015. That is why the EPP Group supports this pact to strengthen the protection of our external borders and prevent threats to the security of our citizens. It is a balance between responsibility and solidarity that eases the pressure particularly on frontline countries, such as Spain, while at the same time providing guarantees to those who genuinely need international protection. United against the pact, as expected, are the extremes: the naive do-goodism on one side and alarmist fatalism on the other.

To determine our vote, let us ask ourselves three questions. Does the Pact address the indignity in the treatment of migrants? Does it address the disorder at the borders? Does it lead Member States to demonstrate collective responsibility and solidarity? In all three cases, the answer is no. And I add: alas! Indeed, it is clear that while we do not know what the Pact will truly achieve, we do know that it will not solve the problems denounced by the Member States. Worse still, it marks unprecedented setbacks for fundamental rights while generalising derogating procedures. Thus, there is the impression of doing something, but without a solution for frontline countries, for example, and without a binding principle of solidarity. Let everyone be aware, furthermore, that the Pact does not address major issues. It is silent on relations with countries of origin for migration and asylum. It will have no effect on the movement of people. It makes no mention of the enormous resources that nevertheless need to be deployed concerning the Pact. It says nothing about the deadly business of smugglers, nor about the necessity of a European 'Search and Rescue' operation, nor about legal pathways. It speaks even less about integration and avoids reflection on climate migration and asylum. It is impossible to support it.\n",

This pact was our chance to share responsibility, end pushbacks, uphold the right to asylum and make reception human again. I acknowledge the improvements. I am glad that we stimulate resettlement and that for the first time Member States must offer solidarity. But I urge them to fulfil this obligation in the only meaningful way, by offering relocation. But I am extremely worried that these rules systematically lock up asylum seekers – even families with children – at the external borders, for months on end. This law erodes the rights and safeguards of asylum seekers and risks dangerous deportations. It allows for undermining the common standards, which is exactly the opposite of what we need.

Next, you introduced forced relocation to countries like Poland or the payment of a migration tax, 20,000 euros per immigrant. What have you actually done? In reality, you've sent a love letter to human traffickers, encouraging them to push as many people as possible into the sea, because it's known they will be accepted anyway, without any criteria. What will be the effects of this? Firstly, you'll line the pockets of smugglers, many people will drown, you'll create problems for Europe, you'll extract money from countries like Poland, and you won't solve any problem.

      "\tMadam President, Commissioner, I think it is clear for everyone that is watching what is happening on the ground today, and they understand that we need to have a new European migration policy. We have horrific numbers of people dying in the Mediterranean Sea. We still see that the majority of people coming to Europe are irregular migrants. We see that we have a lack of trust between Member States, and we also see that we have a lack of trust also from citizens towards governments, towards European politicians. Now, finally, we have something on the table. We have something that is truly negotiated, and we have an opportunity now to find a constructive majority in this House to vote in favour of this migration pact. For years, this House has criticised the Council for not making up their mind, for not being ready to negotiate. Now, finally, we have the Council ready to adopt this and move forward towards a true European migration policy. Should it then be this House who rejects it? Who shows that we are not mature enough to take decisions that would actually mean that we will stick to our European values? Yes, we will have a more controlled migration policy than we have today, but we will also make a choice that we will prioritise the people in need of protection and we will decrease irregular migration. Finally, we will also open up to cooperate more within the Union and together with countries outside of Europe. This is the right path forward and I do hope, colleagues, you will please be responsible today. Please vote in favour of the Migration Pact.\n",

      "\tMadam President, the European Parliament is the only directly elected supranational and legislative institution in the world. We are the democratic expression of the irreducible diversity and complexity of European integration. We come from our 27 Member States, which have not dissolved with the European Union, and we are going to elections on June 9th. And I say this to recall that the legislative procedure from which we come has been extremely difficult. How could it not be? In no way can the negotiators who have participated in it be entirely satisfied, and I am not. I have heard legitimate criticisms, and I respect them. Of course, I have also heard disinformation with refutable arguments as soon as one reads the content of the European Regulations that we are going to approve —I hope— in this session, which is historic. But I profess great respect for those who have criticised it from humanitarian organisations. I want to remind you that there are first-rank international organisations —the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and the International Organization for Migration— that have welcomed the Pact as a step forward and positive. But to those humanitarian organisations that have criticised it, I say: I have made their criticisms my own, I have fought for them in every negotiation, I have battled with all my strength to make their points of view prevail. But, at the same time, I state: we are members of the European Parliament and we are not activists. In this Parliament, we have been elected to decide and legislate, not to indefinitely utter impassioned, but sterile speeches. We have been elected to assume the responsibility of making decisions. And I want to say that the alternative to not voting on each of the Regulations of this Pact is worse. It is not only condemning things to remain as they are, with all our protests, with every plenary session saying «shame, what a shame that the European Union continues to do nothing regarding the migratory phenomenon and the right to asylum». It is not recognising that we have tried and failed. It is something much worse and more disheartening for the future because it will be telling the voters: forget it, the European Union is not capable of responding even when it sets its mind to it and when it spends so many years on the effort. That is why I say: let us not lose the opportunity. It is now or never. After all these years of work, it is worth taking a step forward, with all its limitations, but also establishing order, guarantees, and common rules where there have been none until now. We are going to vote favourably on each of the Regulations of this European Pact.\n",

      "\tMadam President, I thank, above all, those who have attacked Eurodac. Their attacks are the main proof that we are right and that Eurodac goes to the heart of the problem. Illegal immigration is a business from which thousands of people are getting rich. Please, Members on this side , read the Frontex reports. The latest Frontex report literally states that human traffickers in Mauritania have been cramming increasingly large numbers of migrants into pirogues, which puts the lives of those on board in greater danger. Those who endanger people's lives are the traffickers and all those in Europe who call them to come, because these people are not fleeing persecution. In Africa, the only ones being persecuted are Christians murdered by jihadist militias, but you pay little attention to them. Look, on the Central Mediterranean route, protected by Italy, illegal immigration has fallen by 60%. On the Balkan route, protected by Hungary, illegal immigration has fallen by 70%. However, in the other two gateways to Europe —the Western Mediterranean and the Canary Islands route— it has increased by 50% and 540% during these two months of 2024. Yesterday, all Members of the Spanish Congress of Deputies —except those from my party— voted in favour of an amnesty for 500,000 illegal immigrants for an extraordinary regularisation. Why not a million? Thousands of illegal immigrants from Islamic countries are today on social media —the Commissioner will surely know this—, on Facebook, Twitter, and all social media, calling for massive entry into Europe via the Spanish route. This is the reality. These are all those subsidised entities, associations, and NGOs that have been blocking our emails for weeks in an unbearable campaign, but, if they live off illegal immigration, by what authority do they tell us what to vote for? We do not serve lobbies; we serve the voters. Eurodac has been the first stone of these foundations, and in the next legislative term, we will raise the pillars of a beautiful building where law, justice, and security prevail.\n",

      "\tMadam President, I have heard many arguments today, but the one I’ve heard most is: we have to have a deal. We just have to have a deal. But a deal must be judged on its contents. I repeat why we in The Left will vote against this deal. There is no solution to solidarity. There is no shared responsibility to receive asylum seekers. There is no stop to the death in the Mediterranean. Nothing. There will be systematic detention in the borders of Europe. The right to asylum will be dismantled. And there will be more deals with dictators and anti-democratic regimes. Just hear those arguments. So, in The Left, we stand for fundamental rights. We also stand with all those organisations that are demonstrating now outside this building. But they are also working every day to save lives, to demonstrate what it is with solidarity. Look at them and listen to them, please. People here like to say that we are anti-European; I would say you are anti-European. We defend a Europe that stands up for fundamental rights. What do you think people want in the future? What do you think the young people of Europe want? They want a Europe that stands for democracy, human rights, solidarity and fundamental rights. They want workers’ rights and they want climate justice. That’s the Europe they want to build, and they are not okay with us taking decisions that dismantle that future. You say we play into the hands of the far right. I would laugh if it wasn’t so serious. You are walking in their shoes. You are following on their leash, in their narrative, pitting people against each other, pitting migrants and refugees against workers, against young people, against families. You must stop. Instead, start to defend people’s rights – all people’s rights – because that’s the future that we have promised to build together for this Europe: a Europe that protects people, that doesn’t deny them rights. It starts anywhere. It starts everywhere. It starts today with refugee rights.\n",

      "\tMadam President, Honourable Members, thank you sincerely for this debate. This very clearly illustrates the state of the European Union today and also outlines the dangers that could befall Europe if we fail to adopt this package today. We all recognise that the entire package – the solution before us – is not perfect, but it is a compromise. However, there is no alternative to this package. If we were to reject it today, Europe would be plunged into great uncertainty. This would primarily embolden populist forces. Adopting the package is therefore a strategic necessity for the European Union and is our shared responsibility. And immediately afterwards, we will have to focus on implementation. Undoubtedly, there will also be certain challenges and difficulties in this process, and we will have to address them as they arise. There is simply no other way, Honourable Members. This is also what European citizens expect of us. In conclusion, therefore, I once again appeal to all colleagues: support the package! It is not ideal, but there is no alternative. Thank you to all colleagues for your support and cooperation.\n",

      "\tMadam President, as I stated earlier, I will support the package, but I will do so without joy. Now, every one of us in this room has his or her own reasons for voting in favour or against. And I’d like to say to the EPP: no, Greens and Left are not on the same side of the far right if they vote against. I think that’s dishonest. And no, friends of the Greens and Left, those voting in favour, like me, are not on the same side of the far right or anti-European. I have concerns and doubt, and I too struggle with the dilemma. But that is why we are in politics. Because having an opinion is easy. Voting for something perfect is not very difficult, but to take responsibility for dilemmas and difficult decisions is our job. The pact definitely contains problematic elements, risks and weaknesses and it is dishonest to deny that. But it is equally dishonest to claim that this pact is the end of the right to asylum, or that, in itself, it will lead to more violence at the borders. The violence today is not the result of the existing law, but of national policies and the absence of enforcement. I can defend the new Reception Conditions Directive without any hesitation, and those standards (which I had the pleasure to negotiate) will apply across the package. And if I had written the pact, it would look very different. But there will not be any fresh proposals on the table or a better negotiation result. It is false to create that impression and our job does not end here. We have an even bigger task in overseeing implementation and enforcement, and the best guarantee for European values is a solid majority of European liberal democrats who stand tall for human rights. So let’s make it happen in June.\n",

      "\tThe provisions of this migration pact try at all costs to create the impression that the problem with the influx of illegal migrants is controlled and orderly, and the situation – safe. Nothing could be further from the truth. I fear that only now will smugglers, these human traffickers, start behaving like sharks that have smelled blood. Because criminals driving this bloody business see the prospect of even greater profits from this illicit trade. Since Europe declares its readiness to accept illegal migrants, criminals will push them even more numerously onto dilapidated boats and propel them north towards Spain, Italy, or Greece. Fires are extinguished in the bud, and they are not extinguished with gasoline. That is why we proposed that aid for those in need be provided on the spot, in the countries from which migrants flee to Europe, but we were not listened to. We warned against creating once again the deceptive atmosphere of \"Herzlich willkommen,\" which did not prove effective even during Angela Merkel's time, and will certainly not prove effective now. The provisions of this pact will not help reduce the number of illegal migrants, but will further increase their influx into Europe. Even the authors of this document themselves have many doubts and do not hide their dissatisfaction with its provisions. This policy on migration must be decisively changed!\n",

      "\tChanges in human migration require reforms from Europe; relying on old regulations would not have been a solution. The package as a whole takes responsibility for more controlled migration, and even strict measures must be implementable when necessary. The Union is, however, also a continent where people can come and which is safe for them. The package also includes a crisis regulation, important for Finland, for situations where asylum seekers are instrumentalized as part of hybrid influencing. The situation at our eastern border has shown that we will need even more extensive tools for crises. I consider it important that we now get clear rules for the entire EU's Eastern border for situations where Russia seeks to instrumentalize asylum seekers through hybrid influencing. From Finland's perspective, this matter is particularly about national security. The package is a compromise where no one wins everything. The package now approved clarifies legislation as necessary and also aims to prevent organized crime, such as human smuggling. The new, updated rules are an improvement to the current unsustainable situation where old rules were not followed.\n",

      "\tIn 2015, at the peak of migratory pressure, when over 1.8 million irregular migrants entered the EU, Europe failed! Ten years later, Europe faces the second largest flow of migrants. In the first two months of 2024 alone, the number of people who illegally crossed the EU borders is over 30,000, the second highest level since the 2015–2016 crisis. The increase is by 541% on the West African route and by 117% on the Eastern Mediterranean route. Amidst all this, there is also positive news. Frontex reports a 70% decrease in the number of illegal border crossings on the Central Mediterranean route, and a 65% decrease on the Balkan route. Bulgaria, which guards one of the most challenging external borders, that with Turkey, also reports a decrease in migratory pressure. The country notes over a 40% decrease in the number of detained irregular migrants compared to the previous year. A prerequisite for this is the successful implementation of the pilot project with the Commission, which allows for a significant strengthening of border control capacity, accelerated asylum application procedures, and effective returns. For all this, Bulgaria was commended at a hearing of the LIBE Committee, where the Commission cited us as an example of good practices for the entire EU regarding the protection of external borders and migration management.\n",

      "\tAfter eight years of negotiations, an agreement has finally been reached on the migration and asylum policy package. This is a significant step. It is regrettable that some political groups are now attempting to derail this long-negotiated package after all these years. It is clear that the outcome is not perfect, but it unifies asylum policy and streamlines operations at the external borders. The collapse of the package would mean a continuation of the current situation, which is not functional for anyone. Responsibility for migration issues has been unevenly distributed for too long. All EU Member States must bear their share of this responsibility. The new rules now combine binding responsibility with flexibility, allowing Member States to choose their mode of participation. For Finland, as an external border country, it is particularly important that we have unified, efficient practices and information exchange at the EU borders, as well as mutual support among Member States. In the future, we will be better able to combat the abuse of the system. The guarantee of international protection must be ensured for those who need it. At the same time, unfounded applications must be efficiently screened, and necessary return decisions must be made. It is good that the package also provides more means to combat the instrumentalisation of migration in crisis situations, but it does not fully resolve it yet. This theme will likely need to be revisited. But now a significant common foundation has been laid. While the package is an important improvement to the current situation, it does not solve everything. For the future success of the entire EU, there is a great need to open more functional channels for labour migration. Europe is becoming the world's oldest continent, and millions of workers across the entire economic area will be retiring in the coming years. New experts, entrepreneurs, and workers are needed. In the future, there will be increasing competition for them, even within the EU.\n",

      "[ ] 3: Francisco José Millán Mon (PPE - christian_conservative) [0% migration]\n",
      "\tMr President, I thank Vice-President Schinas for his very comprehensive presentation. The European Union is going through a very serious situation. In the last two years, Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine has concentrated our efforts, but it cannot make us forget the Southern Neighbourhood. The serious risk of escalation in the Middle East, the difficulties faced by the countries of the Southern Neighbourhood, or the situation in the Sahel are profound challenges that the European Union cannot ignore. We must act. The agreements with Egypt, or the recent ones with Tunisia and Mauritania, are therefore heading in the right direction. Egypt is a very important neighbour, with significant geostrategic weight. The joint declaration of 17 March, promoted by President Von der Leyen, elevates our partnership with Egypt to a strategic level. This will facilitate political dialogue at the highest level, contribute to strengthening the country's stability, and improve its capacity to face current economic and security threats. Egypt is indeed experiencing a very difficult economic situation, marked by high public debt, elevated inflation, and a severe shortage of foreign currency. I hope that this partnership will contribute to stabilising the country's economy and promoting the necessary structural reforms. This partnership covers other equally important topics — as Vice-President Schinas told us — such as investments in energy, cooperation in the field of migration, or student exchanges — Erasmus+ —, among others. The promotion of democracy, human rights, and fundamental freedoms is also present in the partnership with Egypt. Ladies and gentlemen, Egypt has a great capacity for dialogue with Israel and Palestine. In the current difficult circumstances in the region, Egypt must continue working to achieve a ceasefire and the release of hostages, and to continue facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The European Union cannot aspire to be a global actor if, in its own neighbourhood, it is unable to actively defend its interests and values and act in a cohesive and effective manner. We must contribute decisively to the stability and prosperity of our neighbourhood, which is currently going through a very difficult period.\n",

      "\tMr President, Mr Commissioner, about a month ago, in this very room, as a member of the Committee on Budgets, I openly expressed my opposition to the use of an urgent procedure to make 150 million euros available to Tunisia. We were surprised. In March this year, the process is repeated, now with Egypt, for 7.4 million euros. Loans, investments, and aid for migration-related programmes. All of this without this Parliament exercising its role of democratic scrutiny. The way the European Commission bypassed this Parliament in concluding these agreements is unacceptable. It is inexplicable – and remains unexplained – how agreements of this nature, which must have involved lengthy preparation, do not pass through Parliament? We want to know what conditionalities – beyond the general conditionalities – the Commission established with these agreements with Tunisia and now with Egypt. Was there urgency? We cannot validate these agreements under the argument of urgency, because that is not true. Today we have a new Pact on Asylum and Migration. The European Parliament demonstrated throughout the 9th legislative term that it can act quickly. We did so, for example, in the European response to COVID-19. The European Parliament is the budgetary authority. It does not relinquish its powers, and we cannot think that it is through urgent disbursements that we will become relevant in the Southern Neighbourhood. This is a very limited and very unstrategic view of the problem.\n",
      "[ ] 5: Jan-Christoph Oetjen (ELDR/ALDE/Renew - liberal) [5% migration]\n",
      "\tMr President, Mr Commissioner, honourable colleagues! Egypt has historically long been an important partner for us, the European Union, in the region. And it is right that we conclude comprehensive agreements with such strategic partners, covering all policy areas. However, I find it particularly important to emphasise that it is stipulated that financial support for Egypt is tied to the fulfilment of conditions. The conditions mentioned therein are concrete steps towards effective democratic mechanisms. And it is absolutely right that such conditions exist, honourable colleagues. Unfortunately, in my view, it is not concrete enough as it is written here. One thing is clear: Today, there is virtually no opportunity for civil society in Egypt to express itself openly and critically about the current government.

And regarding migration management, it must also be absolutely clear, in my view, that human rights are non-negotiable, honourable colleagues.

The anomaly is that after two resolutions voted here condemning the actions of the Sisi government, you decided to sign contracts for 7.5 billion. As the standing rapporteur for Egypt in this institution, I have consistently called for strong and precise conditionalities regarding this regime. Through your sleight of hand, Ms von der Leyen ended up receiving a very clear recommendation from the Council. The Council asks you to implement concrete conditionalities in your report to the Sisi regime. If you have no ideas, I will give you some: lift censorship on independent media, release the 60,000 prisoners, stop the pressure on civil society and the opposition, protect sexual equality and the rights of minorities, migrants, and refugees. Today, Mr Commissioner, 18 women were arrested by the Sisi regime because they were demonstrating in front of the United Nations office with a simple petition on the situation in Gaza and Sudan. Where are human rights in this country? Where are the commitments of this regime? After having disregarded Parliament, will Ms von der Leyen also disregard the Council and its recommendations? Stop your hidden agenda. Stop this morbid project which aims to transform the European Union into a World Bank for dictatorships and authoritarian regimes.

      "\tMr President, Egypt is an essential partner for France and the European Union in Africa. Cairo is currently facing immense challenges. Egypt must strive for food, energy, economic, and financial sovereignty, amidst a particularly degraded neighbourhood. The European Union therefore has everything to gain by standing alongside it. While everyone acknowledges Cairo's decisive role in the pursuit of peace in the Holy Land, Egypt's actions are also beneficial elsewhere, both for its region and for the European Union. In Sudan, Egypt plays an essential humanitarian and diplomatic role, while also hosting refugees from the civil war tearing the country apart. At its Libyan border, Egypt ensures the fight against terrorism, just as it has done for years in the Sinai. While the dark hours of the country's domination by Mohammed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood have barely faded, Cairo has regained its pivotal role in international negotiations. I can therefore only welcome Egypt's participation in the Horizon Europe programme. I hope this progress heralds further advancements, particularly regarding a partnership for migration prevention. This is also an excellent signal for European businesses, which benefit from the new prospects opening up in this territory. France is already at the forefront of projects related to the Cairo Metro, but would benefit from investing more in developing Egyptian markets, such as the construction of the New Cairo city. In Egypt, due to strong demographic pressure, immense construction projects are flourishing, in which our businesses must be supported. As competition rages with Chinese, American, and Arab groups, it is important that European companies play a leading role in the country. At the heart of the emergence of a multipolar world, the European Union must support the intensification of its relations with its historical partners. While this parliamentary term has been marked by several resolutions, which were particularly ill-received by the Egyptian Parliament and numerous associations, I can only express my delight at concluding this final plenary session with good news for our relations with Egypt.\n",

Secondly, this agreement is potentially controversial, as it evidently has no legal force whatsoever, nor does it contain any safeguards regarding the respect for human rights.

But we must ask ourselves whether Europe is part of the solution or part of the problem. And at whose expense it concludes such agreements and who it might potentially harm. It would be unacceptable for Europe, without adequate safeguards, to contribute in any way to the violation of human rights and the suppression of democracy and the rule of law.

This agreement was not only signed bypassing the scrutiny of the European Parliament, but it completely ignores the grave rule of law situation in Egypt. Indeed, cooperation with this country cannot be separated from our demand for human rights to be respected, by guaranteeing freedom of expression, releasing arbitrarily detained persons, and ending the repression of minorities. This was reminded to us just in these days, here in the European Parliament, by the presence of Patrick Zaki, detained for months by the Egyptian regime and now finally free, who told us: \"If I am here, it is because you too, in these chambers, believed that fighting for my freedom was a battle to be won.\" Giulio Regeni's parents also ask this of us, he who died more than eight years ago in Egypt and for whom we are still seeking the truth. A truth that the Egyptian authorities continue to cover up and which the Italian government and European authorities should demand with much greater force. Indeed, yes, fighting for freedom and for truth is a battle to be won. And as Europe, we must continue to do so.

Women and girls, in particular, have faced escalating restrictions on their fundamental rights, such as limited access to education, mobility and employment, effectively erasing them from public life. The recent public executions of three individuals, along with the Taliban’s discriminatory restrictions and harsh penalties, are deeply disturbing. The Taliban’s draconian crackdown on dissent and non-compliance with their strict dress code is a clear violation of human rights. It is crucial that we condemn these actions and demand accountability from the de facto authorities in Afghanistan. As the EU, we have a responsibility to address these continuous human rights violations and support the Afghan people, especially women and girls, in their pursuit of justice and freedom. We must fully support the establishment of an international accountability mechanism to collect and preserve evidence of serious violations in Afghanistan. This will be essential for future criminal proceedings and ensuring justice for the victims of human rights abuses.

This without a resolution for tonight, this Wednesday evening, with a speaking slot per political group. And I ask, Madam President, that this be carried out by roll-call vote.\n",

It's simple: on November 16th, the Member States are expected to validate the European Commission's proposal to renew the glyphosate license for an additional ten years. We refuse it. We say stop to glyphosate because when so many independent studies denounce the toxicity of this product for human health, well, reauthorizing glyphosate is criminal. When so many other studies denounce the devastation caused by this herbicide on nature and biodiversity, reauthorizing glyphosate is a betrayal. We must urgently guarantee the protection of our health and of living things by immediately and definitively turning the page on glyphosate. This is a major public health issue. We only have one life. Let's defend it together. So, colleagues, I propose that we add to tomorrow morning's agenda, at 8:30 a.m., a debate with a resolution entitled 'Declaration by the Commission and the Council on the renewal of glyphosate and the urgent need for a phase-out'. This debate would be organized with one speaker per political group, and I would like two separate votes: one on holding the debate and the other on adopting a resolution.\n",

Already in October 2017, this Parliament asked the Commission to ban glyphosate no later than 15 December 2022. Glyphosate is ruining our health and the health of animals. It is polluting our environment, soils and water sources. We don’t need another resolution. We don’t need a phase-out as proposed by the Greens. We need to ban glyphosate now. Therefore, I would like to make a counter-proposal: I ask for a debate without a resolution, and I propose as a title of the debate ‘the need for an immediate ban on glyphosate’.

      "\tMadam President, Your Excellency Mr President, dear colleagues, I would like to welcome the President of my country in this House, which in the European Union has the strongest institutional adherence to European values of democracy, human rights, liberty, solidarity and respect to dignity of each human being, despite what is his or her colour of the skin, and what is his or her sexual or political orientation. The European Union will be strong if it will be based on those values without compromises, if it will be based on those values not only here in the European Parliament or in some other EU institutions, but also on a national, regional and local level. This is the only way how those values can be established also on the whole European continent. Why is it so important to talk about those basic principles and values? Because this is the only way how sustainable peace can be established on the European continent, since there is a very well—known law of geopolitics: only democracies are not fighting with each other. That is why defence of those values everywhere in our Union and the spread of democracy and basic human values into the eastern side of European continent is the most important strategic geopolitical goal for all of us, and especially during this war. We need to recognise, all of us in the European Union: we are not perfect back home in this area. There are things which we need to improve and to strengthen, also in Lithuania. But today I want to elaborate on what our President was speaking about. What should our common strategic agenda be in order to assist the nations in the eastern part of the European continent to enjoy the same European values of democracy and human rights? I want to repeat: sustainable peace on European continent will be established only when Belarusian and Russian people will have a possibility to enjoy those values and to live in normal European conditions. Such a strategic agenda will be implemented only if we shall proceed with a very clear strategic action plan. First, Ukraine needs to decisively defeat Putin’s Russia during this year, and that will create possibilities for big political changes in Russia and Belarus. Our most important obligation: weapons, weapons, weapons… and sanctions. Second, the absolute geopolitical priority for you during this year: to start membership negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova. That would be the most powerful European geopolitical answer to Kremlin hybrid offensive activities in the region, especially in Moldova and perhaps also in Georgia. Third, the integration of Ukraine, Moldova and possibly Georgia towards the EU should be concluded till the end of this decade, since that is the only way how successful and prosperous democracies can be created in those countries. The success of those countries would be an inspiration for Belarusian and Russian societies to follow. Fourth, Ukraine needs to get membership in NATO, if not during the Vilnius summit this year, then during the Washington summit next year. It would help Russian people to abandon their dream to restore empire because Ukraine will be gone. Fifth, the EU needs to show clear perspective. Democratic Belarus will have possibility to integrate into the EU. Democratic Russia will have a special and very practical relationship with the EU. We Lithuanians want to be part of a European Union which is able to implement such a democracy action plan because this is an action plan for sustainable peace on the European continent.\n",

      "\tEsteemed President of Lithuania, Madam President, distinguished colleagues, European citizens observing our discussion, Lithuania, like other countries of similar fate that were destined to experience the oppression and aggression of Soviet totalitarian Russia, knows better than anyone the price of freedom won with blood. Today, Ukraine is in this same position, heroically fighting for its own freedom and ours. It is fighting against the same aggressor, only with a changed name. It is therefore no surprise that from the first day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine until now, the voice of Lithuania and other Baltic States has been the loudest, urging not only the provision of urgent and comprehensive assistance to Ukraine, but also demanding a common and united European Union response to stop Russia's aggression. Here and now. Allow me to remind you that for many years, Lithuania and other Baltic States consistently spoke and warned about the true face of Russia and the objectives of its authoritarian Putin regime. Unfortunately, not all members of the European community were willing to heed these warnings. However, these warnings have become a bloody reality for the people of Ukraine. Today, everyone has acknowledged that the discourse of Lithuania and the Baltic States concerning the bloody objectives of the Kremlin regime was not merely an airing of historical grievances. We did this because we knew how fragile freedom is and how immense its price is, and we aimed to prevent this from happening again in Europe, and to ensure that no nation would ever experience brutal oppression and an assault on its territorial integrity and freedom. Never. I fully agree with our President. Historical memory must not be relegated to the archives. History must not be forgotten, and the war initiated by Putin bears witness to this once again. Therefore, I call upon us to be responsible, united, and courageous, to establish a tribunal for Russia's war crimes, to take all possible actions and impose sanctions to weaken the power of the Kremlin regime, and to help Ukraine win this brutal war, as this is also a guarantor of Europe's long-term security. We must be united in restoring and expanding our defensive capabilities – our security as Europeans will depend on how we pursue this together, jointly, and in a concerted manner. Distinguished colleagues, a strong and resilient Europe can only exist when it is united, socially responsible, just, and progressive. Our goal as socialists and democrats is to strengthen Europe's social foundation and to ensure that the objectives approved at the Porto Summit are fully implemented in all member states. A Social Europe must ensure that even those on minimal incomes can live with dignity and support their families, rather than falling into poverty; that there are no children living in poverty, of whom we still have over 18 million in Europe today; that men and women receive equal pay for the same work; that our pensioners enjoy a dignified old age; and that the rights and freedoms of all people are protected. Only a socially strong, resilient, and responsible Europe will be able to cope with challenges such as the green transition and digitalization, which will inevitably impact Europe's socio-economic model and labor market. However, our people must be at the forefront of all reforms. So, courageously and united for Europe!\n",

But what truly moves the world is what one puts on the table when truth obliges us: money, resources, people one accepts as immigrants.

      "\tMadam President, first of all I wish to welcome the President to the European Parliament and, most importantly – even if we are a bit late – to say ‘Happy Independence Restoration Day’ to Lithuania, of course. More than anything, colleagues, the full—scale invasion of Ukraine has confirmed the need for European unity. And it is true that only together, as Europeans, can we stand up against the brutal imperialism of the Russian regime. We have shown here in the European Parliament that we stand for unwavering solidarity with Ukraine, be it financial, humanitarian, or military support, paving the way for Ukraine to become a member of the European Union. But of course, and you have mentioned it, Mr President, we need full energy independence of the brutal Russian regime. For too long politicians also, and especially from my home country, Germany, have ignored the alert for from our eastern neighbours, like, for example, Lithuania, and now we are paying a high price for this. But colleagues, one thing has to be understood. Simply switching from one energy dependency on one dictatorship to another will not solve any of our problems. Nor does the shift from one fossil fuel dependency to another non-renewable energy source. The only sustainable answer that will prevent us from having the exact same problem that we have been facing in the last year again, in two, five or ten years is to make our energy consumption 100% renewable. That is possible and we have no time to lose. No country in the European Union will manage this alone. Only a strong European Green Deal can make that possible. You are absolutely right. The Green Deal for long already has not only been a measure that we need to protect our climate or to stimulate our economy, it has become the most crucial measure also for strong security in the European continent. But, Mr President, the fight against authoritarianism does not only happen, unfortunately, outside of the European Union. We also have to stay vigilant inside because we can see attempts of undermining our democracy, of undermining separation of powers, rule of law and fundamental rights in the European Union, brutal attacks on press freedom and journalists. We cannot stay silent in the European Union on these developments because the EU is not only a community of trade – we share fundamental values. If we want the EU to be strong and true to its own values, we have to protect all our citizens from these attacks, no matter whether they are from Lithuania or Portugal, no matter their gender, their skin colour or their sexual orientation. Because safeguarding freedom and human dignity means safeguarding freedom and human dignity for all.\n",

      "\tEsteemed Mr. President! Today's war in Ukraine poses a threat to international security and is the cause of an economic crisis. Lasting peace is a supreme value. Lasting peace is also essential, as is solidarity, which would allow us to survive this difficult time. However, there is a big problem today with European solidarity, because some large countries pursue their own, egoistic policies. The Union is also experiencing a crisis of values, those values that once built the Community, and from which we are unfortunately departing. I am saying this primarily to the EU institutions, where there is no development of democracy and free political thought. Unfortunately, an artificial power arrangement blocks the development of freedom, blocks in defiance of democracy, as the will of a large part of the electorate, up to 50%, is rejected. Today's arrangement unites a single goal – power at any cost and the division of \"posts\". This is a peculiar usurpation of democracy. The two main forces in this Parliament – the EPP and the Socialists – although theoretically having different programmes, have for years united immediately after elections to exclude a third force, and in this way do not have to deliver on their programmes. The Socialists promise social programmes but do not implement them. They promise to care for the poorest but support CO2 emissions trading, which causes price increases and the impoverishment of people. The EPP declares that it upholds Christian values, but does not defend life from conception to natural death, does not protect marriage understood as a union between a woman and a man, and often supports gender ideology, which has nothing to do with true Christian Democracy. Additionally, both forces impose the creation of an EU federation, which destroys the Europe of nations that it was intended to be in the vision of its founders, Schuman and others. Unfortunately, this artificial political arrangement blocks free thought and ideas. The EPP-Socialist arrangement does not allow for any alternative, the so-called third force. Such a system encourages political corruption, which we are witnessing in Parliament. This harmful and undemocratic practice is also being transferred to the level of member states. Even our President Gitanas Nausėda is being attacked, and his election challenged, although he received 67% of the votes. This is not conducive to democracy. Europe is becoming an ideological void due to the EPP and Socialist arrangement. It is in disarray. Therefore, in the name of true European solidarity, a third or fourth force is needed that will be able to heal Europe, to restore its true face based on its roots. It is precisely the ECR that is the force that recognises this and wants to change it, as we discussed recently at summits in Warsaw and Madrid. We also spoke about the need to strengthen Europe's energy independence and the development of its own industry, including heavy and defence industries. In accordance with this idea, today we would not be facing problems with our defence capabilities in an era of aggression in Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! Europe and the Union need more democracy and freedom based on Christian values, the traditional family, and free thought, because such is the true soul of Europe.\n",

      "\tMadam President, President Nausėda of Lithuania, first of all I am more than happy to be here as from one from the Baltic States, from Estonia. And I really appreciate your several statements that Latvia and Lithuania have been together in history and the good and also in the bad times If we just remind the history, it was pretty easy for Russia — they called it the Soviet Union at the time but it was Russia, the same thing — to break down each country one by one because all those three countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, had their own some kind of policy. And for Moscow, it wasn’t very hard to have some kind of deals each by each. And the result we know pretty well and it’s just experience for the history. If you try to make some kind of deals with Satan, you are the loser from the beginning, there is no chance. To remind some of the necessity of the support to Ukraine. We all agree, most of us agree here. And there is different kind of ways to help Ukraine. But the most necessary definitely is military aid. As we can see in the news, the next weeks and the next months will be very crucial in Ukraine because both sides haven’t won. And if somebody’s saying that there is no winner in the war, there is. The winner can be only Ukraine, because if they lose we will be the next ones. And there is no question about that. As I looked just on the statistics, the resources, those three Baltic states have given the biggest military and financial aid to Ukraine. Estonia with 1%, Latvia with 0.98%, Lithuania with 0.65% of the GDP. And the fourth one is Poland with 0.63%. At the same time, there has been very huge help from the US and from the UK. But they can do more. And the problem for us now is that we really don’t have a lot yet to really give to Ukraine. But there are much more to give from the US, from the UK, also from Germany and France. Germany has given 0.17% of the GDP, France 0.07% of the GDP. Those are just cold facts and numbers. And now the question is: are they really brave enough to make this change in the war or not? Because if we will lose this momentum now, in the next month, we will face the new war in the next two or three years. So just a moment to think which kind of chances we have if somebody is talking about the peace negotiations. The peace can be only if the conditions are good for us. And the only conditions that are good for us can be that there is no ambitions for Russia to start any kind of aggression in next decades. I will not say ‘forever’. We shouldn’t be very naive. Russia will not disappear. But the only thing what we can do is just to weaken them as much as possible and to show that they cannot win their neighbours. And finally, I would like to really thank you that Lithuania was one of the countries two years ago who showed how to deal with illegal migration. There is no question that if you are the war refugee, you need help. There is no doubt. But what we saw in Belarus, it was just illegal migration, what was used by Belarus for the hybrid attacks. And Lithuania, together with Poland, just shut down the border and said ‘there is no way to enter to the European countries through those countries illegally’, because if you open the border, there would be no ending, no ending at all. And you did absolutely well. So labai ačiū, thank you so much. And good luck for the Baltic cooperation.\n",

To achieve these goals, we need a European Union that is not just a common market and \"a bit of a political union\". We need a stronger Community budget, larger than 1% of European GDP, with more own resources, with more money for reducing social inequalities, which have increased, to support the poorest countries and the poorest social categories, to implement the Green Deal; a European Union that must remain a project of peace and democracy. Because democracy is suffering even within the European Union: in Poland and in Hungary, unfortunately also in my homeland Greece, and I do not think, Mr President, that you yourself are satisfied that democracy is at its best in Lithuania either. Therefore, we must respect the rule of law and avoid the risk of paralysis in the Council, where unanimity often becomes a weapon in the hands of blackmailers, of governments that block the functioning of the European Union to extort, to achieve something for their own interests. Regarding enlargement, let us be honest. Let us not promise the peoples of Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine things that require years and changes and conditions. Beware!

They were occupied and they remained independent. I remember that, in 1987, our Prime Minister, from our party, Cavaco Silva – who was Prime Minister ten years and President of the Republic ten years – had a huge conflict with the Parliament because he didn’t agree with a visit to the Soviet Union, where the territories of Baltic states were included.

And today, Mr President, we are very proud because your country became a world front runner of defence, of democracy, of freedom, of human rights. This was clear when you sent all the support to the Ukrainian people, but also when you are claiming for democracy in Belarus and when you are saying that you don’t accept the blackmail of China. The example of the Ukrainian solidarity shows that you want for other countries in Europe, and I dare say in world, the same fate that Lithuania had, which was in a very, very oppressive regime and managed to become independent and to give freedom, prosperity and human rights’ respect to all the citizens.

And yet, for the concrete problems that the peoples face – exacerbated by the policies of sanctions, sector liberalization, production concentration, precariousness, and low wages promoted by the European Union – solutions continue to be lacking. Where are the measures to reverse the increase in poverty and halt the indecent concentration of wealth? Where are the measures to curb the loss of purchasing power and the brutal increase in the cost of living? What are the measures to put an end to the exploitation and speculation of large economic and financial groups and their obscene profits? What initiatives are there to invest in public services and defend universal and solidarity-based social security? What proposals are there to put an end to the assault on labour rights, the increase in exploitation, precariousness, and the deregulation of working hours? The peoples want peace, they want what is being denied to them. In Portugal, as across Europe, the mobilization of populations, of workers, is intensifying. Actions demanding the right to a dignified life, to work with rights, to increased wages are multiplying. For an end to speculation and profiteering, for intervention in markets, for the setting of maximum prices. For the right to health, to education, to housing. For peace.

And we hear your government justify these violations under the misguided arguments of fighting instrumentalisation. But what you are doing is fighting innocent victims in need of protection.

All of this at a time when our freedom was not taken for granted and when it was challenged by many, primarily by stronger and larger neighbors. Both Croatia and Ukraine suffered aggression. Croatia defended itself, liberated itself, and today knows very well what Ukraine is going through: years of prepared aggression, strong propaganda attacks, but also the orchestration and support of internal rebellion. This is what Ukraine is experiencing today, this is what Croatia survived, and essentially, all of this was prepared, perhaps in different forms, for the Baltic states as well. In the past decade, the Baltic states have felt disinformation attacks, as well as attacks on their digital infrastructure. Ukraine also suffers most from attacks on civilian infrastructure today. Croatia, although far from any military threat, is still exposed to various cultural encroachments today. Although we are different in many ways and at different historical moments, one thing is very much common to us: we know who we are, we know what our values are, and we know where we belong.

You mentioned not only the Russian dictator, but also the Belarusian one. Almost one and a half thousand political prisoners are held in inhumane conditions in Belarus. Therefore, I would like to ask that the European Council, together with the urging of the European Parliament, does everything possible to ensure that political prisoners are released, including Ales Bialiatski, Maria Kalesnikava, Mikalai Statkevich, and others. Nevertheless, despite the crisis caused by Russia's aggression in the economy and other sectors, and the resilience of our citizens, some are profiting from that crisis. We have seen enormous excess profits in the energy sector, and in some parts of the pharmaceutical and banking sectors. I believe that common efforts are needed to curb these excess profits and for the funds to be allocated to the most necessary defence and the creation of a welfare state.

However, European legislation does not recognise a legal instrument for the protection of non-food traditional products, and Croatian cultural heritage abounds in such products.

Pag lace, the Šibenik button, or Slavonian gold embroidery are just some of the traditional jewels of our region whose manufacturing technique has been carefully preserved and passed down from generation to generation.

Why do they want to make life more complicated and duller for ordinary people? It's not dangerous to have fresh teeth. It's not dangerous to smell good. So stop this nonsense now and leave people alone!\n",

      "\tMr. President, regarding Portugal's GDP growth last year, the highest since 1987, two points. First, this growth is accompanied by the largest fall in the share of wages in GDP during the same period. Real wages have decreased, workers have lost purchasing power, many are becoming poorer while working. Economic groups are increasing their profits, increasing inequalities and injustices. This reality is inseparable from the guidelines, pressures, and impositions of the European Union, to which successive governments have submitted, from attacks on collective bargaining, from public sector wage restrictions, from underinvestment in public services and in the social functions of the State. Second, despite the economic bias of this growth and the exceptional circumstances explaining it, it exposes the absurdity of insisting on debt reduction through budget surpluses and the dictatorship of the deficit. As proven, economic growth is the path to faster and more sustained debt reduction.\n",

      "\tMr President, despite the police having been given free rein, appointees of former Smer governments and their patrons are still protected in Slovakia. The Prosecutor General shamelessly uses Article 363 to quash prosecutions, especially when the accused are friends, family, appointees, sponsors, or fellow party members of former Prime Ministers Fico and Pellegrini. He even used this legal loophole to drop charges against Robert Fico himself and Robert Kaliňák. The scenario is the same every time: just before the investigation findings are submitted to court, the Prosecutor General uses Article 363, and the corruption charges are dropped. The police even produced a video from a hunting lodge, in which Robert Fico himself boasts precisely about his coordination with the Prosecutor General. There are therefore reasonable suspicions that the Prosecutor General abuses this legal loophole in favour of the cronies of Smer and Hlas. Shamelessly, he also fails to see a criminal offence related to the kidnapping of a Vietnamese national, who was brought from Germany to Slovakia and from where he was secretly transported to Russia by government jet. While in Germany, all who cooperated in this kidnapping were convicted, in Slovakia, the Prosecutor General still sees no reason for criminal prosecution. What is a criminal offence in Germany is not a criminal offence in Slovakia.\n",

      "\tPresident, on the night of 20 to 21 July 2020, French President Macron's plane was warming up at Brussels airport. The negotiations surrounding the European Corona Emergency Fund were over. Prime Minister Mark Rutte had said no. The Netherlands refused to pay for an EU recovery plan. But then it happened! European Council President Charles Michel's phone rang. It was Prime Minister Rutte. On the orders of his D66 Deputy Prime Minister Sigrid Kaag, he still wanted to negotiate. Result: over EUR 800 billion in common EU debt, on account of the Netherlands' AAA guarantee. Today, Macron comes begging again, this time for a green industry fund. Again, Mark Rutte says no. But who believes him anymore? President, it really must be different. Member States and governments must take their own responsibility. The Dutch taxpayer cannot continue to do that for them. For JA21, it is no, and it remains no.\n",

      "\tMr President, on 6 March last year the security services of Ukraine, the SBU, arrested the First Secretary of the Ukrainian Komsomol, Mikhail Kononovich, and his brother, Aleksander. They were accused of treason and spreading pro-Russian views. These two young communists are subjected to physical and psychological torture, beatings, lashings, sleep deprivation and threats of execution. Political repression of communists, peace activists and progressive forces is common in both Ukraine and Russia. If Russians do it, it’s a travesty. Yet, when Ukrainians do it, it is to spread democracy and representing European values. Member States are divided on speeding up accession for Ukraine, and rightly so. The level of corruption is comical. The Zelenskyy government empowers far-right extremists and neo-Nazis while destroying workers’ rights and banning 12 opposition parties – and, as we can see from the case of the Kononovich brothers, are busy persecuting them. We cannot just ignore this oppression! We can start by calling for the release of these two men.\n",

      "\tToday I wish to address a topic concerning Serbia, a state that aspires to join the European Union. However, when it embarked on this path, Romania made the respect of this status conditional on the granting of rights to national minorities. The Romanian minority is extremely numerous in this country, but fundamental rights continue to be curtailed. And here I want to pay tribute to the vicar of the Romanian Orthodox Church in Serbia, specifically of the \"Dacia Ripensis\" Deanery in the Timok Valley, Eastern Serbia, who has been extremely heavily persecuted by the authorities throughout his 20 years of activity. I assure him of my full respect, and I believe that Serbia must join the European Union, but it has an obligation to respect all its citizens, including the Romanian minority.\n",

      "\tIt is up to us alone how we arrange our common European home. Whether it will be strong and based on principles, or weak and stripped of its values. Yes, the Union is a home, and our role is to strengthen this home. This is why we were elected: to ensure it is secured against enemies, to protect the weakest, and for its inhabitants to live in harmony and prosperity. However, in this home of ours, there are those who slander the family and carry out the family silver. Such people are here. Some torpedo sanctions against Putin and do not provide weapons to Ukraine; others, day after day, spit on the Union, replicating Kremlin propaganda. This is the moment in Europe's history when a stronger and more integrated Union is needed. Firstly, an end to the pathological veto rule in the Council, which allows Orbán to block sanctions. Secondly, energy independence for the entire European Union. Thirdly, Putin's nightmare: a common European army and a common foreign policy. A strong European Union means a secure future for millions of Europeans.\n",

      "\tMr President, many mountain regions, but also structurally disadvantaged regions, poor regions, continue to decline, becoming depopulated, as if they had no future. They are not attractive for young people, development is rather stagnant, and at the same time, it must be said that these regions are essentially abandoned, abandoned within our European Union. It seems as if cohesion policy is failing in some areas, as if our Just Transition Fund has not functioned as we imagine. Unfortunately, many regions, on the contrary, function like a funnel, like a growth pole, where everyone wants to live. I believe we must address these issues of our cohesion regional policy's failure much better than we have done so far. It is important to make agriculture more attractive; it is important to find attractive, lucrative work and opportunities for many companies in these regions. Otherwise, our rural areas will become depopulated and stagnant.\n",

      "\tMr President, I had my name on the list. I was told that there wasn’t enough time and there were too many speakers, but we’ve only had 27. We still have time and some people didn’t turn up. So I’m just wondering what the story is. I can go on? Thank you so much, I really appreciate it, you are a gentleman. Italian anarchist Alfredo Cospito is on his 105th day of hunger strike against the ‘41—bis’ prison regime under which he is incarcerated. It’s a prison regime which authorises the violation of human rights: no phone calls, no parcels, no mixing with other prisoners, 22—hour lockup, one visit a month; a prison regime condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for breaching two of its articles. Yet this regime continues to exist in an EU Member State, unchallenged in our so-called democracies. Alfredo has lost over 40 kilos. His potassium levels have dropped. He will die unless action is taken. The Minister for Justice, who must rule on the revocation by 12 February 12, has said he’s going to leave the decision to the judiciary until 7 March. This is a death sentence. Alfredo doesn’t have that time left. So the question is, will the EU remain silent? This is a human rights issue. Over 200 jurists and lawyers have condemned his treatment. 41—bis must be revoked.\n",

Regarding mobility, the available data show that the reliability of visa applicants is high, and there are few rejected applications. The country does not pose any threat in terms of irregular migration, security and public order. I also consider it important that the visa exemption is not a negligible means of bringing the population of the European Union and the citizens of the country concerned closer together. The visa-free agreement allows citizens to fully enjoy the opportunities provided by the partnership, more cheaply and more easily.\n",

This arrangement will apply to journeys of up to 90 days in any 180 day period. The only exception will be travel for the purpose of performing paid work, for which a work visa will still be required. Thus, cooperation between the EU and East Timor is also being strengthened at the political level. We know that economic cooperation is already very good, and with this agreement, in my opinion, it will be even stronger, especially in the field of tourism. This is a key sector for the country's development, so strengthening cooperation is extremely important. I agree that the abolition of the visa requirement between the two parties is an important means of bringing European and Pacific nations closer together.

Tourism, as one of the most important branches of Timor-Leste's economy, represents a key sector in the development path of this democratic republic, and therefore a freer flow of passengers would strengthen not only tourist movements, but also investments, since the European Union is the third trade partner with the countries of the Pacific. However, in order to achieve integral, multi-sector and sustainable development, both of this country and of the countries in the ACP group, it is necessary to ensure strong coordination and harmony between the institutions that implement the decisions. In doing so, I emphasize the role that national parliaments and local authorities play in the preparatory phase as well as in the monitoring of strategic agreements. I also believe that control mechanisms, i.e. monitoring, which must ensure compliance with agreed standards in order to avoid unwanted consequences of such agreements, should not be neglected. Therefore, the border services should be responsible and careful when performing controls, i.e. determining whether the intention is to travel for a shorter period or to stay longer than planned.\n",

Many of us hope that new chapters in negotiations will be opened so that both Serbia and other Balkan countries will soon become members. The problem is that you falter. There is still an idea that Serbia can have two mothers, both the EU and Russia, because while Serbia is reaching out to the EU, it has not followed the EU's foreign policy towards Russia. They have allowed Russia to dominate Serbia's energy market and thus exposed themselves to future pressures. It is preparing a joint military exercise with Russia and supports the statements aimed at dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina. Therefore, it feels important to add to the report an encouragement to Serbia to continue on the chosen path of rapprochement with the EU. That is where Serbia's future lies. Likewise, it feels important to encourage the Commission to help Serbia be able to detach itself from Russia. Serbia can be the EU's bridge to Russia, but then it must first be part of the EU. I want to add that to my vote and therefore I choose to vote for both Serbia's, and it is in the EU's and Serbia's interest to make this possible.\n",

In a new history of that vast country, Serhii Plokhii makes the argument that, between 1932 when Stalin began the famine and 1944 when the last of the Nazi troops left, it was the most dangerous place in the world to be a human being. Even by the standards of that troubled and turbulent country, the Crimean Tatars have suffered particularly. I had meetings with a number of their leaders when I was last in Ukraine, and they told me the same things that are detailed in this report – the human rights abuses, the restrictions on free speech, free assembly, free religion and all the rest of it. How much this House can intervene in a distant land is a separate question, but at least let us be clear whose side we are on, where our sympathy lies.

However, the positive decision to open negotiation chapters is not so much due to Belgrade making significant progress in internal reforms - it is rather due to Serbia's constructive policy towards neighboring countries, primarily Kosovo, and the appropriate attitude of the local government during the immigration crisis. I supported this report also because it cannot be denied that Belgrade's decisions saved us from an even greater humanitarian catastrophe. However, as the report clearly shows, the country still has huge problems adapting to EU requirements in the area of justice and home affairs. Negotiations on these chapters are just beginning, but it can be assumed that they will not be easy. Another problem, somewhat omitted, is the difficult economic situation in this country. Many migrants who came to Germany, Sweden or Norway have Serbian citizenship. This shows that poverty in this country may trigger waves of migration to the EU.

What is worth emphasizing here is the pursuit of the principles of democracy, which is manifested, among others, in the activity of citizens and the presence of constructive opposition and media freedom, which is an inherent component of democracy. In the case of Serbia, its role in the stabilization of the region and its development is also worth emphasizing.

The principle of the rule of law and an independent judiciary are of key importance for Serbia.

I am also satisfied because our colleagues in the European Parliament have begun to understand how problematic the Law on the Organization and Jurisdiction of State Bodies in War Crimes Proceedings is, by which Serbia abuses the principle of universal jurisdiction, as evidenced by the amendment of the author of the resolution itself, which was adopted today, and by which this the issue became international. In the case of Serbia, the European Commission can no longer push problems under the carpet, but must start solving them. Therefore, I once again invite them to seriously study the disputed Law and ask Serbia to repeal Articles 2 and 3 of that Law. It is also necessary to facilitate the transfer of Veljko Marić to Croatia and provide him with a fair trial.\n",

I support the contents of the motion, which encourages Serbia to prepare a separate action plan for the situation of national minorities. The settlement of the minority situation in the Western Balkans is not necessary because of the European Union, it cannot be a mandatory task to be carried out as a result of external pressure, but must be an expression of an internal demand that can steer the processes in the direction of normality.

Accession negotiations were opened in early 2014. The implementation of the Stabilization and Association Agreement has improved, and commitment to European integration is visible. It is important to create prerequisites for the opening of negotiation chapters 23 and 24 as soon as possible, as well as Serbia's engagement in building good-neighborly relations with Kosovo, and cooperation in the fight against criminal groups. Considering the events during the 90s, Serbia should continue cooperation with the International Criminal Court, strengthen cooperation with Croatia and other countries in order to collect data on missing persons. Cooperation with neighboring countries should be continued, bilateral relations should be improved and bilateral issues should be resolved. Progress was made in the judiciary through the implementation of the Strategic and Action Plan for the Reform of the Judiciary for the period 2013-2018. It is important that the issue of Vojvodina is highlighted in the resolution. It is important that the autonomy of Vojvodina must not be narrowed, and in this sense the Resolution calls for the adoption of a law on the jurisdiction and financing of AP Vojvodina.

If such cooperation is established, not only Serbia can benefit, but also its neighbors, while increasing connections and energy security in the region. The process of changes taking place in Serbia requires opening further chapters in the negotiation process with the EU, but the most important thing now is to continue the reforms that have already started. Despite visible progress, it cannot be ruled out that there will be disruptions, as in the case of the difficult initial period in the implementation of social reforms. Efforts should also be made to resolve problems related to the abuse of power, but this will require the involvement and appropriate attitude of the state.

We cannot allow Belgrade - or any current or future member state - to formulate and shape its relations with Russia against common EU interests.

Dear Commissioner, I'm going to ask you two simple questions tonight, and I think you'd actually like to answer no to these simple questions. But I ask the first question: Is this German car toll compliant with EU law? At this point I would also like to quote a proven expert on these questions, who said: A road user fee is only compliant with EU law if it does not discriminate on the basis of nationality. It's not me saying that, it's what you said, Commissioner Bulc, at the start of the infringement procedure in June 2015. Accordingly, let us start from this principle. Has this discrimination now been eliminated through the supposed agreement? Not in my opinion. As before, EU foreigners are still burdened more heavily than German citizens. Or simply put: A Belgian driver with a Euro 6 car pays the toll, a German driver does not. Hence the answer to the first question “Is the new German toll model compliant with EU law?”: No, it is not. I come to the second question: Is this toll a symbol of good European cooperation? Here too the answer: No, it is not. There is currently no European toll system. This toll violates the fundamental principles of our Union, which you and the Commission must protect. There should not be the feeling that our European partners are financing Germany's roads at the expense of their neighbors. Because then what would be the result? The long-term consequence would be that we would undermine the basic principles of the internal market and coexistence in Europe. That's why this toll must have no place in Europe, especially not in our time when so many doubt the EU. Ms. Bulc, you have it in your hands. The process is currently on hold. Therefore, an urgent appeal to you: continue the infringement procedure, otherwise Member States will sue. And have no doubt: this idea is gaining more and more support because it is about more than just tolls, it is about the fundamental principles of our European Union.\n",

Firstly, the Commission seems to have problems applying the same standards to large Member States as to small ones. As a reminder: In Europe it is still really the strength of the law and not the law of the strongest that counts. Secondly: After the submission to the Bundestag, Commission President Juncker personally announced in May 2015 that the toll would be examined due to significant doubts regarding European law. In September 2016 the Commission decided to refer Germany to the European Court of Justice and on 3 An agreement was then surprisingly announced in November. Commissioner, what has changed? I still pay more for the same car on the same route just because I have an Austrian license plate, regardless of the emissions class. Discrimination is still discrimination. Thirdly: Although Transport Minister Dobrindt deserves another European thistle in his collection, I would also like to take a stand for the German approach. If there is a European solution as part of the revision of the Eurovignette Directive, then national taxes must go down. But if – as in the present case – only the neighboring countries should bear the burden for German taxpayers, then that is not acceptable. The Commission is called upon to take a closer look. Cross-border mobility should not and must not be punished. Drivers, regardless of nationality, are not fair game for finance ministers and populists – see Article 18.

Nevertheless, dear Commissioner, the questions that Mrs Schmidt just asked are still on the table. I would like to recall that we spoke to each other repeatedly at the beginning of this period, when this proposal was on the table. We have discussed all of these components and ultimately they still do not contribute to making the whole thing, which started as a foreigners' toll on the part of the CSU, ultimately compliant with European law. It is still the case that you have just admitted that there will not be one-to-one compensation for German drivers. And you continue to admit that it ultimately has to conform to the user and polluter principle. So I ask myself: Where does this proposal correspond to this user and polluter principle? And I would also like to ask you, Commissioner: What did the European Commission get in return? Is it true that the European Commission has thereby bought, or at least bought, the Federal Republic of Germany's consent to the EETS legislation? Is that right? Yes or no? And also, say quite openly: Why did this statement or at least this deal ultimately take place exactly in the week in which the CSU party conference took place in Bavaria?

Initially, you said, Commissioner, that it would be better to negotiate with the German Government before the measure became law; now, when it has become law, you are waiting to think what to do. I think there is a contradiction in that statement. Other possible reasons could be that the Commission made legal mistakes when it started infringement proceedings – and if that is not the case, I would like more information about the changes – or that the German Government has made enough political statements to remove discrimination against car owners from other countries and drivers of environment-friendly cars?

The fact is: we have a Euregio region right in the border area with the Netherlands. It was deliberately set up to have cross-border traffic and work. There are many people who live in the Netherlands and work in Lower Saxony. There are more jobs here in Lower Saxony, so there are more people there who can fill the jobs.

Mr. Dobrindt still says today: The Germans no longer pay. That means: Who pays for it then? The question is, of course, from a German perspective: Is there even enough income? Isn't this perhaps a zero-sum game? But we have to discuss this in Germany. In general, I actually think that this principle user pays, polluter pays is of course good. It would be best if we had no car tax at all, everywhere in all European countries, and you only pay whenever you drive. That would be the fairest and best thing. Of course, that's not possible at the moment because we can't simply say: everyone has to abolish vehicle tax. But what we have on the table now is actually not a good blueprint. Last thing: It's not mileage-based either, it's not like you pay for every mile. There are still different sections – month and so on. That's not what we need and it's far too bureaucratic.\n",

However, I firmly believe that we must demand from the German side – and I am asking you to do it not only in the form of words, but concrete actions on the part of the Commission – so that it does not do so in a way that is discriminatory towards drivers from other member countries. I consider the German toll concept to be discriminatory because it means that all Germans will be reimbursed to a large extent and only foreigners will de facto pay the tolls. I want to declare here that if it is confirmed that there will be negative discriminatory effects for the member countries, the court should also discuss this issue, and not just the European Parliament. We only ask for fair terms that will be the same for all parties. After all, as directly elected representatives of the 28 member countries, we have a moral duty to see that all citizens are treated equally, and we should not stand by when money is taken out of some people's pockets while others are not. You have known about the problem for a long time and unfortunately you did nothing for a long time. Now is the time that if you do nothing, it will get worse and worse and you will only prove to the European citizens that the European Commission does not do what it should and just looks on.

As early as 1990, the then Transport Minister Zimmermann wanted to implement the truck toll and reduce the vehicle tax for trucks. Did the Commission say no? In 1992 the European Court of Justice said: This is anti-European. With that it was buried. In 2004, the then federal government wanted to try the same thing. The Commission said again: This is anti-European. It was then introduced anyway. Now Alexander Dobrindt comes with his third attempt. I always say: mistakes make you wise. But for Alexander Dobrindt two weren't enough. Why is it so? The toll is anti-European; it prevents cross-border traffic. It costs. Only foreigners pay – not Germans. That doesn't work. In addition, the vignette is unecological and anti-social because someone who drives 10,000 kilometers a year pays exactly as much as someone who drives 200,000 kilometers. That has nothing at all to do with the user and polluter pays principle. That's why it has to be stopped, and I can't understand why the Commission initially said: This is anti-European, and then, after Juncker met with the CSU in Bavaria - passing by the Commissioner, by the way - that everything should then be legal . That doesn't work. The Bundestag still has to decide on it. But if he decides to do that, then I think, because it's anti-social, then not only the SPD but also the CSU would have to delete the S in their name, because that's totally anti-social.\n",

And now about the alleged discrimination. I cannot recognize this, and the Commissioner rightly stated it: every user of our German motorways should pay in the future, and I emphasize: every user - regardless of their nationality. The question of tax was also raised. Reducing vehicle tax is a matter for the Member States. In Austria there is also a commuter allowance. There is also a tax break for drivers driving in Austria. That's fine. That's okay with us too. A final word about our Austrian friends. Dear colleagues, if I drive from Munich to Bolzano at the weekend, I only pay just under 40 euros for road use. I have to pay the Austrian ten-day vignette, I pay for the Europa Bridge, I pay the Italian toll.

      "\tMr President, Madam Commissioner, with the return of the Taliban to power, following the uncoordinated withdrawal of the United States, barbarism has taken hold of Afghanistan and, once again, women have been the main victims. The heavy cloak of invisibility and dehumanisation has once again fallen upon them, with their right to education, work, free movement, freedom of expression, and their own identity being denied anew. But if all of this is, in itself, atrocious and unacceptable, the news of public executions surpasses all bounds of brutality. The death penalty is degrading and intolerable in modern times, and public executions represent a return to the deepest darkness. It is our duty to support Afghan civil society, to be swift in granting humanitarian visas to persecuted women and human rights defenders, as well as to demand the release of victims of violence against women and girls held in absolutely degrading prisons, and the abolition of the death penalty and the immediate end to public executions.\n",

Women’s futures and opportunities are being sacrificed in the name of radicalised Sharia law. We must condemn loudly and clearly every crime committed by the Taliban against Afghan society and give hope for a different future. I call on Afghanistan’s regional neighbours, the Arab League and other cooperating states to influence the Taliban leadership to demand changes in women’s rights, education and participation in public life. The European Union must, has supported, and will continue to support those human rights and educational activities who continue their work in Afghanistan and abroad, providing the necessary services to an Afghan society that deserves a different set of opportunities and prospects for the country.\n",

Because not a single thing has improved for women and girls. The gender apartheid installed by the Taliban is still alive. The human rights and the humanitarian crisis have not improved at all. But this status quo makes it all the more important that the EU offers support and solidarity to the Afghan population in and outside of the country. But also this is, sadly enough, still far too little and that’s also a status quo. Humanitarian organisations still lack funding. Local staff is still stuck without help. Afghans still face pushbacks and rejected asylum applications. We need to drastically change our policies towards Afghans and give them the support they deserve. Be strong on the five benchmarks, but also support civil society, human rights defenders, women and girls – specifically in their education but also in their health services – and step up our resettlement and humanitarian visa. And last but not least, finally complete the evacuation of the Afghan local staff that worked for EU missions and operations. Please do what we promised once because if the EU doesn’t care for them, no one will.\n",

The very radical interpretation of Sharia law in particular is violent against women and girls. They are practically banned from access to public life, work, healthcare and education without male-relative companionship. It is also extremely violent against minorities like Hazara and Tajiks, with the return of public executions. We have to demand change within the country.

      "\tA Uachtaráin, the situation in Afghanistan is alarming, with human rights violations occurring daily, including arrests, detentions, abductions, tortures and killings. Since the Taliban takeover, there has been a complete lack of accountability for these atrocities. Women and girls, in particular, have faced escalating restrictions on their fundamental rights, such as limited access to education, mobility and employment, effectively erasing them from public life. The recent public executions of three individuals, along with the Taliban’s discriminatory restrictions and harsh penalties, are deeply disturbing. The Taliban’s draconian crackdown on dissent and non-compliance with their strict dress code is a clear violation of human rights. It is crucial that we condemn these actions and demand accountability from the de facto authorities in Afghanistan. As the EU, we have a responsibility to address these continuous human rights violations and support the Afghan people, especially women and girls, in their pursuit of justice and freedom. We must fully support the establishment of an international accountability mechanism to collect and preserve evidence of serious violations in Afghanistan. This will be essential for future criminal proceedings and ensuring justice for the victims of human rights abuses. Finally, I reiterate my calls for the European Commission and Member States to facilitate scholarships exclusively for Afghan women and girls. By bringing women back into education, we are not saving them from Afghanistan; we are saving them for Afghanistan in the future.\n",

No school, no sports, no work, or going to the park. They face daily physical and sexual violence, and all they want is a life. They dream of something that resembles a future, but it is a hell without prospect.

Public executions, floggings, prohibition from schooling, prohibition from moving without a guardian: we are witnessing the brutal suppression of all the rights they have acquired over the last two decades. In a deafening international silence, the Taliban are erasing women from public life, dismantling government structures, imposing Sharia law in place of the judicial system. Domestic violence and forced marriages are exploding. Almost every day, a new prohibition annihilates the few rights women still have. The lives of Afghan women are now reduced to being under the yoke of men, walled up alive. A few days ago, we celebrated International Women's Day.

Indeed, nothing has been spared for the women concerned, from their exclusion from higher education or – the height of pettiness – from Kabul's public parks to the ban on working for NGOs – which puts international donors against the wall, I will come back to this. Not to mention the silent tragedies, the widespread domestic violence, or the wave of suicides affecting Afghan women, and about which the authorities are, obviously, not very forthcoming.

You see, Mr President, last week I promoted a very clear poster campaign. It conveyed, through text in Arabic and Italian, a very simple message: \"In Europe you have the same rights as your husband.\" Since that day, I have been deluged with offenses, insults, threats, and instead of solidarity, I found the blame of the left and feminists, perhaps too busy condemning the West to notice what is truly happening in countries where women's rights are genuinely violated. And so I quote the words of a great woman, a great writer, addressed specifically to our local feminists: \"To the female cicadas, that is, to the feminists of ill repute, I have something to say: Drop the mask, false Amazons.  How is it that concerning your Afghan sisters, concerning the creatures murdered, tortured by  misogynists in skirts and turbans, you imitate the silence of your little men? How is it that you never organize a little bark in front of the embassy of Afghanistan,  or of some other  Islamic country that violates women's rights?

Of course, the twenty years of our presence were marked by light and shadow, but the hasty abandonment by the Americans and us Europeans has plunged Afghanistan back into the darkness of obscurantism.

Such events will create new migration waves and will increase the security challenge on our borders. We cannot allow this to happen and have to insist on the fulfilment of the region’s counter-terrorism commitments. In the meantime, the EU has to rethink its security and defence mechanism. In addition, women are suffering under the Taliban rule. Nowhere have women and girls’ rights been challenged as they have been in Afghanistan. The Ministry of Women’s Affairs has been dismantled. Participation of women in leadership roles is restricted. Women leaders, officials and activists are persecuted. Female activists’ activities in public life have ceased to exist. I strongly condemn the recent decision by the Taliban to bar secondary education for girls. Women and girls are crucial contributors to a resilient and prosperous society, to a strong economy. Without the right to education, women are pushed into poverty and submission.

But the Taliban's seizure of power on 15 August 2021 marked a return to the situation that characterized the country 20 years ago, nullifying the few advances made in human rights and, above all, women's rights. Systematically, their access to education has been denied. Even access to healthcare is only open to women if they are accompanied by a guardian. The Taliban have established a system that Afghan women activists have called a gender apartheid regime. This debate is all the more timely and necessary today because, on the morning of 23 March, the Taliban communicated to Afghan female students over the age of twelve that their doors would remain closed. In this Parliament, we have listened to and exchanged with many extraordinary women such as Shaharzad Akbar or Sima Samar, both presidents of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, or Zarifa Ghafari, mayor of Maidan Shar, and still others. They shared with us their strong concerns on several points, such as their fear regarding what they perceive as a dangerous normalisation of the relationship with the Taliban, and the duplicity of the Taliban, who presented themselves as open to dialogue while, at the same time, brutally demonstrating their refusal to engage with democratic civic space. They also shared with us the destruction of the social fabric and the lack of accountability of this brutal regime. Through this resolution, we reaffirm that taking power through violence and arms does not make the Taliban legitimate; that the European Union's intervention in Afghanistan will ensure that women are involved in the planning, monitoring, and management of aid programmes; that we will ensure access to quality education; that we will show no tolerance for corruption or discrimination; that we will ensure that civil society and the media are protected.

Just last summer, our anger and frustration were targeted at the Taliban takeover, which has turned Afghan lives into absolute hell. The Taliban is showing its real face as a brutal oppressor and a jailer of women and girls. More than 4 million girls are stuck at home, while women are deprived of their right to work, to study and to travel freely. Girls face forced marriages. And formal official or government members, journalists, human rights defenders and minorities are attacked, detained and killed. We must prioritise their human rights by making tough demands towards the Taliban, by reaching out to protect them. The Taliban takeover has also made the lives of all Afghan people extremely dire. More than 24 million people depend on humanitarian aid, and the drought, pandemic and the freezing of international aid have deepened this crisis. The Russian invasion has even increased food insecurity due to skyrocketing grain prices. We must ensure that sanctions effectively target the Taliban, without undermining the basic socioeconomic rights of the poor Afghan people, by creating alternative ways to reach them and by stepping up humanitarian aid. Because if we do not act now, we risk more people dying from the humanitarian crisis in the country than from the last 20 years of conflict. Many people are at immediate risk of persecution in Afghanistan, and they need our support to leave the country and be protected elsewhere. I call upon the High Representative and the Commission to step up the coordination for evacuation and to press Member States to enhance their visa and resettlement policies. We must invest in the better protection of refugees in neighbouring countries. But let’s be fair: there is a clear need for safe passage to our embassies and the European Union as well.

Everyone has the responsibility to change that, especially the Taliban leadership; so this goes to you. In August, in your famous press conference, you promised to respect women’s rights and media freedom; but now, for 200 days, girls have been banned from going to school. This is self-sabotage on a national scale, and we all know that many of your daughters are actually going to schools and universities abroad. So why shouldn’t all Afghan girls have the same rights as your daughters? Why don’t you just allow them to go to school? And then, dear colleagues, it is also about our own responsibility. What happened to our promise to protect human rights defenders, activists and journalists? If this Union can set up a clearing house and raise EUR 1 billion to send weapons to Ukraine – and don’t get me wrong, I am all for that – why can’t we do the same to evacuate those at high risk from Afghanistan? Why do we put the burden on the most vulnerable? Why do we force NGOs to run from Member State to Member State with lists, begging for attention, dealing with opaque processes with little to no success? Civil disobedience on the ground in Afghanistan is growing. The diaspora is getting organised. It is not too late for us to step up, to organise coordinated evacuation for those who need to leave, and to put in place a fund to support those who decide to stay. We all have a responsibility to Afghan women and girls, and there is no withdrawal from that.\n",

Afghanistan, with its immense and arid mountains, with its turbaned men with piercing gazes, and with its endless poppy fields. We have grown up or grown old with Afghanistan at war, with the USSR, with Bernard Kouchner, with Commander Massoud and the Taliban on television, and then, this summer, with the Americans who fled this land of war overnight. This sudden return to customs of another era reminds us of our inability to implant women's rights in distant societies where many fundamentally reject our way of life. What did the Americans do there for all these years? Did they truly believe that by changing the regime, they could change Afghan society as a whole? They left Afghanistan in ruins. They left this country in the hands of the Taliban. 'When houses were locked from the inside, American soldiers would batter them down with battering rams, forcibly removing women's veils,' wrote Emmanuel Razavi, a veteran reporter, this summer. So, I think of all these Afghan women who, ultimately, are paying for our arrogance in believing that we can impose our way of life on the entire planet. It is our collective failure. 2 trillion dollars were invested in Afghanistan by the United States over the last 20 years, with 500 billion of that used to pay the interest on the debt. France lost 90 soldiers and had 700 wounded there. Who knows if 1 trillion more euros could change this country? Who knows if another 1000 amputee soldiers could change this country? I see that some colleagues are organising a flashmob tomorrow in solidarity with these Afghan women. Do you really think a flashmob will change this country? The urgency is to manage these millions of refugees arriving here in Europe, especially with these men who come with their customs from another century and who try to impose them on our daughters, our sisters, our mothers, and even on these Afghan women refugees. I will conclude with this horrific incident from November 2021, an Afghan migrant...\n",

In Afghanistan, violent groups have seized power, devastating the lives of many innocent people, especially women and children, without a strong response from the European Union, or even with the EU normalizing relations with these illegitimate powers. The European Union, in light of this reality, shows great moral weakness and a lack of international leadership. What can be achieved by limiting action to debates such as this? The European Union must be consistent with its essence, anchored in the values of its faith, culture, and traditions, if it wants to inspire the defense and promotion of human rights, instead of confusing consciences with ideological interpretations of them and remaining silent before those truly responsible for the dramatic situation of Afghan women.\n",

Today they are holding Afghanistan’s entire population hostage as 20 million Afghans face acute hunger. All they care about is repressing Afghans, brave women and girls for cynical political aims. We must never recognise this totalitarian Taliban regime. Any practical engagement must be made conditional on the free participation of women and girls in all aspects of society. I applaud the Commission for helping vulnerable Afghans directly and for setting up the World Afghan Women Leaders Forum.

Thus, the Commission, which claims it will quadruple its humanitarian aid, seems almost to condone this unequal treatment. Furthermore, despite the official narrative, the Taliban will be indispensable for the distribution of this valuable support – with all the risks of misappropriation that one can imagine.

      "\tMadam President, Your Excellency Mr President, dear colleagues, I would like to welcome the President of my country in this House, which in the European Union has the strongest institutional adherence to European values of democracy, human rights, liberty, solidarity and respect to dignity of each human being, despite what is his or her colour of the skin, and what is his or her sexual or political orientation. The European Union will be strong if it will be based on those values without compromises, if it will be based on those values not only here in the European Parliament or in some other EU institutions, but also on a national, regional and local level. This is the only way how those values can be established also on the whole European continent. Why is it so important to talk about those basic principles and values? Because this is the only way how sustainable peace can be established on the European continent, since there is a very well—known law of geopolitics: only democracies are not fighting with each other. That is why defence of those values everywhere in our Union and the spread of democracy and basic human values into the eastern side of European continent is the most important strategic geopolitical goal for all of us, and especially during this war. We need to recognise, all of us in the European Union: we are not perfect back home in this area. There are things which we need to improve and to strengthen, also in Lithuania. But today I want to elaborate on what our President was speaking about. What should our common strategic agenda be in order to assist the nations in the eastern part of the European continent to enjoy the same European values of democracy and human rights? I want to repeat: sustainable peace on European continent will be established only when Belarusian and Russian people will have a possibility to enjoy those values and to live in normal European conditions. Such a strategic agenda will be implemented only if we shall proceed with a very clear strategic action plan. First, Ukraine needs to decisively defeat Putin’s Russia during this year, and that will create possibilities for big political changes in Russia and Belarus. Our most important obligation: weapons, weapons, weapons… and sanctions. Second, the absolute geopolitical priority for you during this year: to start membership negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova. That would be the most powerful European geopolitical answer to Kremlin hybrid offensive activities in the region, especially in Moldova and perhaps also in Georgia. Third, the integration of Ukraine, Moldova and possibly Georgia towards the EU should be concluded till the end of this decade, since that is the only way how successful and prosperous democracies can be created in those countries. The success of those countries would be an inspiration for Belarusian and Russian societies to follow. Fourth, Ukraine needs to get membership in NATO, if not during the Vilnius summit this year, then during the Washington summit next year. It would help Russian people to abandon their dream to restore empire because Ukraine will be gone. Fifth, the EU needs to show clear perspective. Democratic Belarus will have possibility to integrate into the EU. Democratic Russia will have a special and very practical relationship with the EU. We Lithuanians want to be part of a European Union which is able to implement such a democracy action plan because this is an action plan for sustainable peace on the European continent.\n",

      "\tEsteemed President of Lithuania, Madam President, distinguished colleagues, European citizens observing our discussion, Lithuania, like other countries of similar fate that were destined to experience the oppression and aggression of Soviet totalitarian Russia, knows better than anyone the price of freedom won with blood. Today, Ukraine is in this same position, heroically fighting for its own freedom and ours. It is fighting against the same aggressor, only with a changed name. It is therefore no surprise that from the first day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine until now, the voice of Lithuania and other Baltic States has been the loudest, urging not only the provision of urgent and comprehensive assistance to Ukraine, but also demanding a common and united European Union response to stop Russia's aggression. Here and now. Allow me to remind you that for many years, Lithuania and other Baltic States consistently spoke and warned about the true face of Russia and the objectives of its authoritarian Putin regime. Unfortunately, not all members of the European community were willing to heed these warnings. However, these warnings have become a bloody reality for the people of Ukraine. Today, everyone has acknowledged that the discourse of Lithuania and the Baltic States concerning the bloody objectives of the Kremlin regime was not merely an airing of historical grievances. We did this because we knew how fragile freedom is and how immense its price is, and we aimed to prevent this from happening again in Europe, and to ensure that no nation would ever experience brutal oppression and an assault on its territorial integrity and freedom. Never. I fully agree with our President. Historical memory must not be relegated to the archives. History must not be forgotten, and the war initiated by Putin bears witness to this once again. Therefore, I call upon us to be responsible, united, and courageous, to establish a tribunal for Russia's war crimes, to take all possible actions and impose sanctions to weaken the power of the Kremlin regime, and to help Ukraine win this brutal war, as this is also a guarantor of Europe's long-term security. We must be united in restoring and expanding our defensive capabilities – our security as Europeans will depend on how we pursue this together, jointly, and in a concerted manner. Distinguished colleagues, a strong and resilient Europe can only exist when it is united, socially responsible, just, and progressive. Our goal as socialists and democrats is to strengthen Europe's social foundation and to ensure that the objectives approved at the Porto Summit are fully implemented in all member states. A Social Europe must ensure that even those on minimal incomes can live with dignity and support their families, rather than falling into poverty; that there are no children living in poverty, of whom we still have over 18 million in Europe today; that men and women receive equal pay for the same work; that our pensioners enjoy a dignified old age; and that the rights and freedoms of all people are protected. Only a socially strong, resilient, and responsible Europe will be able to cope with challenges such as the green transition and digitalization, which will inevitably impact Europe's socio-economic model and labor market. However, our people must be at the forefront of all reforms. So, courageously and united for Europe!\n",

More than anything, colleagues, the full—scale invasion of Ukraine has confirmed the need for European unity. And it is true that only together, as Europeans, can we stand up against the brutal imperialism of the Russian regime. We have shown here in the European Parliament that we stand for unwavering solidarity with Ukraine, be it financial, humanitarian, or military support, paving the way for Ukraine to become a member of the European Union. But of course, and you have mentioned it, Mr President, we need full energy independence of the brutal Russian regime. For too long politicians also, and especially from my home country, Germany, have ignored the alert for from our eastern neighbours, like, for example, Lithuania, and now we are paying a high price for this. But colleagues, one thing has to be understood. Simply switching from one energy dependency on one dictatorship to another will not solve any of our problems. Nor does the shift from one fossil fuel dependency to another non-renewable energy source. The only sustainable answer that will prevent us from having the exact same problem that we have been facing in the last year again, in two, five or ten years is to make our energy consumption 100% renewable. That is possible and we have no time to lose. No country in the European Union will manage this alone. Only a strong European Green Deal can make that possible. You are absolutely right. The Green Deal for long already has not only been a measure that we need to protect our climate or to stimulate our economy, it has become the most crucial measure also for strong security in the European continent. But, Mr President, the fight against authoritarianism does not only happen, unfortunately, outside of the European Union. We also have to stay vigilant inside because we can see attempts of undermining our democracy, of undermining separation of powers, rule of law and fundamental rights in the European Union, brutal attacks on press freedom and journalists. We cannot stay silent in the European Union on these developments because the EU is not only a community of trade – we share fundamental values. If we want the EU to be strong and true to its own values, we have to protect all our citizens from these attacks, no matter whether they are from Lithuania or Portugal, no matter their gender, their skin colour or their sexual orientation.

      "\tEsteemed Mr. President! Today's war in Ukraine poses a threat to international security and is the cause of an economic crisis. Lasting peace is a supreme value. Lasting peace is also essential, as is solidarity, which would allow us to survive this difficult time. However, there is a big problem today with European solidarity, because some large countries pursue their own, egoistic policies. The Union is also experiencing a crisis of values, those values that once built the Community, and from which we are unfortunately departing. I am saying this primarily to the EU institutions, where there is no development of democracy and free political thought. Unfortunately, an artificial power arrangement blocks the development of freedom, blocks in defiance of democracy, as the will of a large part of the electorate, up to 50%, is rejected. Today's arrangement unites a single goal – power at any cost and the division of \"posts\". This is a peculiar usurpation of democracy. The two main forces in this Parliament – the EPP and the Socialists – although theoretically having different programmes, have for years united immediately after elections to exclude a third force, and in this way do not have to deliver on their programmes. The Socialists promise social programmes but do not implement them. They promise to care for the poorest but support CO2 emissions trading, which causes price increases and the impoverishment of people. The EPP declares that it upholds Christian values, but does not defend life from conception to natural death, does not protect marriage understood as a union between a woman and a man, and often supports gender ideology, which has nothing to do with true Christian Democracy. Additionally, both forces impose the creation of an EU federation, which destroys the Europe of nations that it was intended to be in the vision of its founders, Schuman and others. Unfortunately, this artificial political arrangement blocks free thought and ideas. The EPP-Socialist arrangement does not allow for any alternative, the so-called third force. Such a system encourages political corruption, which we are witnessing in Parliament. This harmful and undemocratic practice is also being transferred to the level of member states. Even our President Gitanas Nausėda is being attacked, and his election challenged, although he received 67% of the votes. This is not conducive to democracy. Europe is becoming an ideological void due to the EPP and Socialist arrangement. It is in disarray. Therefore, in the name of true European solidarity, a third or fourth force is needed that will be able to heal Europe, to restore its true face based on its roots. It is precisely the ECR that is the force that recognises this and wants to change it, as we discussed recently at summits in Warsaw and Madrid. We also spoke about the need to strengthen Europe's energy independence and the development of its own industry, including heavy and defence industries. In accordance with this idea, today we would not be facing problems with our defence capabilities in an era of aggression in Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! Europe and the Union need more democracy and freedom based on Christian values, the traditional family, and free thought, because such is the true soul of Europe.\n",

And I really appreciate your several statements that Latvia and Lithuania have been together in history and the good and also in the bad times If we just remind the history, it was pretty easy for Russia — they called it the Soviet Union at the time but it was Russia, the same thing — to break down each country one by one because all those three countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, had their own some kind of policy. And for Moscow, it wasn’t very hard to have some kind of deals each by each. And the result we know pretty well and it’s just experience for the history. If you try to make some kind of deals with Satan, you are the loser from the beginning, there is no chance. To remind some of the necessity of the support to Ukraine. We all agree, most of us agree here. And there is different kind of ways to help Ukraine. But the most necessary definitely is military aid. As we can see in the news, the next weeks and the next months will be very crucial in Ukraine because both sides haven’t won. And if somebody’s saying that there is no winner in the war, there is. The winner can be only Ukraine, because if they lose we will be the next ones. And there is no question about that. As I looked just on the statistics, the resources, those three Baltic states have given the biggest military and financial aid to Ukraine. Estonia with 1%, Latvia with 0.98%, Lithuania with 0.65% of the GDP. And the fourth one is Poland with 0.63%. At the same time, there has been very huge help from the US and from the UK. But they can do more. And the problem for us now is that we really don’t have a lot yet to really give to Ukraine. But there are much more to give from the US, from the UK, also from Germany and France. Germany has given 0.17% of the GDP, France 0.07% of the GDP. Those are just cold facts and numbers. And now the question is: are they really brave enough to make this change in the war or not? Because if we will lose this momentum now, in the next month, we will face the new war in the next two or three years. So just a moment to think which kind of chances we have if somebody is talking about the peace negotiations. The peace can be only if the conditions are good for us. And the only conditions that are good for us can be that there is no ambitions for Russia to start any kind of aggression in next decades. I will not say ‘forever’. We shouldn’t be very naive. Russia will not disappear. But the only thing what we can do is just to weaken them as much as possible and to show that they cannot win their neighbours. And finally, I would like to really thank you that Lithuania was one of the countries two years ago who showed how to deal with illegal migration. There is no question that if you are the war refugee, you need help. There is no doubt. But what we saw in Belarus, it was just illegal migration, what was used by Belarus for the hybrid attacks. And Lithuania, together with Poland, just shut down the border and said ‘there is no way to enter to the European countries through those countries illegally’, because if you open the border, there would be no ending, no ending at all. And you did absolutely well. So labai ačiū, thank you so much. And good luck for the Baltic cooperation.\n",

For me, it must be clear, and I speak on this occasion also as my group's spokesperson on constitutional affairs, that there can be no enlargement without deepening. It is not sustainable to go to a Foreign Affairs Council with 30, 32 or 33 states with a right of veto in foreign policy, for example. Or that we also need unanimity to approve the multiannual financial framework with 33 member states and, let us not forget, 33 national ratifications. Therefore, Mr. President Nausėda, I encourage you to also contribute to the debate in the European Council to pave the way for the adoption of a new Treaty that is more democratic, more efficient and, therefore, more federal.\n",

It takes courage to open your borders, welcoming and protecting opponents of Lukashenka's dictatorial regime. It takes courage to assert oneself in the face of a belligerent Russian neighbour with expansionist threats. It takes courage to stand up to Chinese authoritarianism. It takes courage never to turn your back on your allies. Your country has shown this courage; your people embody it. Your country has shown us what some did not want and still do not want to see: that national sovereignty is strengthened by European solidarity. Your country demonstrates what some reject: that greater European unity is synonymous with the protection of our values and our citizens. Yes, the European Union must always remain united. That is why, and you have mentioned it, a strong, responsive, effective anti-coercion instrument, which cannot be blocked by a Member State, is imperative. Yes, it is a necessity to be able to react, to be able to protect ourselves when third states seek to limit our freedom. Mr President, your country and the Lithuanians show that acting as Europeans is the only way to defend democracy, to respond to today's challenges, and to build our strategic autonomy. Faced with the pandemic, we acted as Europeans: the joint purchase of vaccines, the transfer of patients between Member States, the adoption of the recovery plan. Faced with the illegal and unjustified aggression against Ukraine, we are acting as Europeans: sanctions, macro-financial assistance, provision of weapons. Faced with the energy crisis, we continue to act as Europeans: creation of new supply lines, reinvestment in new green energies, creation of a social climate fund. Faced with the siren calls of division, we must continue to act as Europeans: let us strengthen dialogue between our societies, strengthen dialogue between our states, strengthen dialogue with third states. Let us continue to act as sovereign and solidary Europeans. Because to overcome critical dependencies, to feed our fellow citizens, to meet the challenge of climate transition, to leave no one behind, we must engage in dialogue, make progress, but above all, act together. In Parliament, we are ready for this. It is up to us to follow this path. The path your people are charting so that these actions do not go unanswered and that we collectively live up to the concerns and aspirations of all Europeans. And allow me also, Mr President, to say, even though my colleague Nicolas Bay has already left the chamber and has not said a word for your country, that the French will never align themselves with the positions defended by the National Rally and all extremists.\n",

Mr. President, I would like to sincerely thank you for your contribution and your continuous work in providing the necessary, essential and timely support to Ukraine. On the eve of this war, you visited and met with the President of Ukraine, and you tirelessly convince the leaders of other countries that it is necessary to support Ukraine by organizing financial and military assistance and providing all necessary support. For this, my sincere thanks to you. Nevertheless, a more active policy from you would also be desirable in addressing internal problems, including those of Lithuania, such as enormous inflation, soaring food and energy prices, and a jump in bank interest rates, which makes it difficult for individual families to survive. There is concern regarding the income of the country's farmers, the management of the milk crisis, and the potential consequences of this crisis for the future of Lithuanian agriculture. I am concerned that the country's regional policy has still not met expectations, as the income gap between those living in the country's regions and the capital is still quite significant. These are also, of course, European problems. I understand that the war in Ukraine has exacerbated these problems. But merely stating this is not a solution.

All of this at a time when our freedom was not taken for granted and when it was challenged by many, primarily by stronger and larger neighbors. Both Croatia and Ukraine suffered aggression. Croatia defended itself, liberated itself, and today knows very well what Ukraine is going through: years of prepared aggression, strong propaganda attacks, but also the orchestration and support of internal rebellion. This is what Ukraine is experiencing today, this is what Croatia survived, and essentially, all of this was prepared, perhaps in different forms, for the Baltic states as well. In the past decade, the Baltic states have felt disinformation attacks, as well as attacks on their digital infrastructure. Ukraine also suffers most from attacks on civilian infrastructure today. Croatia, although far from any military threat, is still exposed to various cultural encroachments today. Although we are different in many ways and at different historical moments, one thing is very much common to us: we know who we are, we know what our values are, and we know where we belong.

I also want to take this opportunity to thank the people of Lithuania who have welcomed refugees and supported Ukraine and its armed forces. Discussions are taking place today, but I fully agree with you that the only guarantee for peace is the expulsion of the occupying forces from Ukraine, a special tribunal and the punishment of the aggressor criminals, as well as Ukraine's full membership in the European Union and NATO. You mentioned not only the Russian dictator, but also the Belarusian one. Almost one and a half thousand political prisoners are held in inhumane conditions in Belarus. Therefore, I would like to ask that the European Council, together with the urging of the European Parliament, does everything possible to ensure that political prisoners are released, including Ales Bialiatski, Maria Kalesnikava, Mikalai Statkevich, and others. Nevertheless, despite the crisis caused by Russia's aggression in the economy and other sectors, and the resilience of our citizens, some are profiting from that crisis. We have seen enormous excess profits in the energy sector, and in some parts of the pharmaceutical and banking sectors. I believe that common efforts are needed to curb these excess profits and for the funds to be allocated to the most necessary defence and the creation of a welfare state. We also see how important it is to ensure food production.

According to a report in Dagens Nyheter in 2010, Dawit lived as prisoner no. 36 in a desolate prison, chained underground. The cells are said to be damp, overcrowded and unhealthy. The prisoners have poor access to water and are starving, but the most important thing in the article can still be said to be that it was confirmed from credible sources that Dawit Isaak was still alive at the time.

When documents are falsified, they undermine internal security in the Schengen area, which is an area of free movement without border controls. This new law addresses this problem by ensuring enhanced cooperation between European Union Member States and partner countries, to take steps regarding the authenticity or falsity of documents. This will guarantee greater security at the external borders and the security of the citizens we represent. We know that the only way we can enjoy the benefits that the Schengen area brings is for our citizens to have confidence in the management of the external borders. And this law is instrumental and essential in all of this – borders, security, and the fight against crime. The new law will help to identify and intercept falsified documents. This law provides a framework for this to happen without delay and with the assistance of Frontex, which will also be responsible for sharing information with all participating countries, assisting and informing them on how to detect situations involving document falsification. The law clarifies Frontex's role in establishing FADO. We have strengthened what falls under this law so that FADO includes more information than it does today. We want uniformity and consistency in the level of information that FADO holds regarding the genuineness, falsity, and fraudulent nature of documents, and for the information to be centralised. We also wanted Frontex to have the necessary flexibility to establish and improve FADO. We ensured that the Agency drafts a new document on effective measures for identifying falsification methods. Naturally, we did everything we could to ensure personal data is compliant with European laws. The result should lead to greater protection while simultaneously guaranteeing stricter security. FADO is essential in the fight against falsification, particularly at the external borders. The participation of countries that are not European Union partners but participate in the Schengen area is also crucial, as ultimately this will have a positive impact on the security of the external borders. This might seem like an overly technical system, but it is a system which I believe we agree is essential to complement the reform of European borders and the protection of these borders. In these negotiations, we did our utmost to broaden the responsibilities falling under this Regulation.

The use of fraudulent documents by foreign citizens seeking a better life in Europe is common, and the cost of such a document can reach up to 5-6 thousand euros. Document fraud is one of the main enablers for terrorism and organised crime and is linked to the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and stolen vehicles, as well as human trafficking and, especially in recent years, migrant smuggling. Not infrequently, the obtaining of authentic travel documents is based on fraudulent identity documents. This is precisely what makes their detection so difficult. In this regard, it is crucial to enhance the security of travel documents issued in the European Union, including the related identity management infrastructure. On the other hand, cooperation between different authorities must go beyond law enforcement activities, as it requires establishing links with document-issuing authorities, as well as with international organisations, airlines, shipping companies, and others.

The protection of personal data was one of the main issues that we had to deal with during the negotiations of this file, and we made sure that the processing of personal data is limited to what is strictly necessary for the purpose of detecting or investigating document fraud. We also introduced clear rules on accessing the database, with Member States now having an express obligation to determine which authorities competent in the area of document fraud are to have access to the FADO system and their level of access, and then to notify the Commission and the Agency. The Commission, upon request, will now have to transmit this information to this House. The negotiated text complements the reform of the EBCGA and will ensure better protection of the Union’s external borders and more efficient law enforcement. I therefore encourage my fellow MEPs to support this text.\n",

      "\tMr. President, honourable colleagues, I thank our colleague Ms. Metsola for her work. In recent years, we have witnessed a significant increase in document fraud in the Schengen area, perpetrated both through the falsification of genuine documents and the use of forged documents. This measure will allow us to integrate the management of the online system for false and authentic documents, known as FADO, within Frontex, whose management model is now obsolete. The need for defence and security that our citizens demand of us compels us to ensure a very high level of alert against false documents, as they are criminal tools suitable for reuse in various crimes, including money laundering and terrorism, but above all, illegal immigration. Indeed, forged documents have often been used by asylum seekers attempting to enter Europe. These are behaviours that we cannot tolerate and that must be stopped. It therefore becomes essential to provide the police, border guards, and customs with a more efficient database, capable of allowing for the rapid identification of falsified documents and effective combatting of these phenomena. For these reasons, we support the proposal, despite our stated disagreement with some private entities accessing FADO, even if with limitations. Although we are against the reform of the Frontex agency's regulation, we consider the importance of using FADO today to be paramount in the fraud combatting activities carried out by Member State authorities.\n",

While understanding the legal reasons for the change in legal basis, we regret that Frontex is being entrusted with the management of this database. We will obviously be vigilant to ensure that this does not portend a strengthening of the agency's mandate – FADO is not a tool to combat migration, but rather an instrument to combat false documents in general. The overall compromise is balanced, particularly through the establishment of safeguards allowing third parties, namely airlines from third countries, to access the database, albeit with limited access. Although the database contains little personal data, it nevertheless seemed necessary to us to make any identification via documents in FADO impossible, which is now the case. Finally, we will closely monitor the publication of the various delegated acts.\n",

In 2018, according to Frontex, 7,000 foreign nationals were detected presenting fake travel documents at the external border crossing points of the Union. Various forgery methods are used as a true multi-purpose tool in the commission of crimes —money laundering, terrorism— and as a key for illegal entry into the territory of the European Union. This fact highlights the great importance that the protection of our borders and migration control have for the security of our nationals. The Regulation, the FADO system, will facilitate, leveraging Frontex's experience, a rapid and efficient exchange of information, without prejudice, furthermore, to Member States being able to develop better systems for the detection, prevention and prosecution of crimes. In this case, our group, concerned by this investigation and prosecution of crimes and by the rigorous control of the legal or illegal entry of foreign nationals into our territory, will vote in favour, and we encourage the rest of the House to do the same.\n",

We see that Frontex already detects around 7,000 such cases annually, and this number has only been increasing recently in the Schengen area. This is concerning, because wherever false documents are used, our security is at stake. It is therefore crucial that police officers and border guards across Europe can verify the authenticity of documents from other Member States, that they are aware of the technical specifications of those documents from other countries, and that fake copies circulating in the EU are truly known everywhere. This truly represents a European added value: sharing information between Member States, ensuring that this information is always updated, and ensuring that this information is accessible and available to everyone 24/7. This new system is therefore a very welcome and much-needed new system, because in the area of security, too, we are stronger together than alone.

For effective enforcement action, however, a constant exchange of information is necessary, which must not only take place between the authorities of the Union countries but also, with the necessary safeguards for personal data, with European institutions, third countries, and private entities, such as airlines, which can contribute to the proper functioning of the FADO system. Numerous investigations conducted by Europol have repeatedly shown that forged documents are often the means used by criminal organisations to commit other much more serious crimes, such as human trafficking, migrant smuggling, or even for the preparation of terrorist attacks. To prevent the commission of such crimes, therefore, among other measures, stricter control at external borders is necessary. We therefore welcome the fact that the regulation transfers the competence relating to the system for managing forged and authentic documents to FADO, from the Council to Frontex, thus finally completing the legislative reform of this agency, a reform which, however, must be followed by proper and complete implementation to truly make the rules approved so far effective.

The use of falsified documents in the Schengen area has, as my colleagues have said, increased considerably over the years, and especially in recent years, and it is therefore essential that we take action. The methods of falsification are changing, and therefore we must always be one step ahead of those with malicious intentions. This will allow us to ensure better protection of the European Union's external borders, safeguard the free movement of persons – which is, in principle, a fundamental point for us – and facilitate the movement of people across borders who are carrying a valid identity, travel, or residence document. This will assist authorities in identifying falsified documents, providing them with the necessary tools they have long requested, simply so they can perform their duties. All of this will have the positive effect of protecting the rights of individuals whose identity is, unfortunately, being used by criminal circles, naturally without their knowledge of this identity abuse. I would also like to respond to a particular intervention from my colleagues, those from the Green Party; we have succeeded in striking the right balance between the protection of fundamental rights and security.

      "\tMr President, the Millennium Development Goals set clear objectives that include the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger and the drastic reduction of child mortality. Looking at progress in this area, we have made progress, but despite that, the number of children dying or suffering from undernutrition remains unacceptably high. This oral question and resolution seeks to ensure this issue is given the priority it deserves by the Commission in our collective action towards the post-2015 global development framework. Undernutrition represents an enormous development challenge. The World Health Organisation says that undernutrition is the biggest contributor to child mortality, causing 35% of the disease burden in children under five. It can create a vicious cycle of poverty, can reduce productivity and impede social and economic development. That is why the fight against child undernutrition and the provision of universal access to adequate nutritious food should remain as one of the major goals in the post-2015 agenda. We voted on Tuesday on that issue, and it is something we do feel is very important. In the draft document by the Own Working Group of the United Nations, goal 2 of the draft SDGs has a target to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030 and by 2025 achieve the internationally-agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under five. The World Health Organisation Assembly endorses the global target for a 40% reduction of the global number of children under five who are stunted by 2025. That means reducing the number of stunted children by more than 70 million – 70 million, colleagues – by 2025. In the Stier report on Tuesday, our Parliament voted with a huge majority to support this objective and goes further, calling for the zero hunger goal to end the scandal of hunger by 2025. It calls for promoting sustainable agriculture and recognising the specific needs of women farmers related to food security. These are vital efforts in our fight against child malnutrition. So what we are asking the Commission for this morning, and why we have asked for this debate, is because we now need a concrete action plan from the Commission on how we, as the European Union, can contribute to the child undernutrition targets, and how we can work with our international partners to achieve this. I understand that the Commission services have been working on an action plan on nutrition, and I wonder, Commissioner, could you update us on this and tell us what is happening and when we can expect something concrete? And how can the Commission ensure coordination, both in its different policies and with our international partners, in speeding up progress towards the WHO targets? Reduced and ending child undernutrition is possible but, like our other development policies, it requires resources, coordination and political will. This week we have had a debate marking the 25th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Tackling undernutrition in the next 15 to 20 years would be a key contribution to make sure that every child could have the basic right that gives them the opportunity for a decent life.\n",

It was already mentioned here that this week we voted on the document, what will happen after 2015 with the Millennium Goals. Malnutrition is a truly complex problem that burdens the entire society. It lies as a burden, because basic human rights are not respected when there is insufficient nutrition, and that is the right to a dignified life of the smallest, those children who live in hunger. When we consider that several children die every minute, not because there is a war in their countries and not because they are sick, but because they are hungry. And it's not just those children who die, it's other children, thousands and thousands of children, who suffer lifelong consequences from this lack of nutrition. We are talking about numbers here - I think we already know those numbers almost by heart, but cooperation is important, cooperation is important both with the institutions of the European Union, but also with other organizations that deal with nutrition, especially with the FAO.

But then, looking at them a little more closely, we realize that they are not at all inevitable or inexorable, that they are tragic but perfectly solvable realities. We know how it should be done, we know what tools should be put in place, we know the causes of these phenomena and we see their effects. And therefore I think that the very fact – as my colleague also said – that they are not inevitable should really make us take on a great responsibility and understand that if it is possible to do it, we must do it. The problem is whether we are able, whether we want to deploy the tools and above all do it adequately. Today this phenomenon of malnutrition, of child malnutrition, takes on even more subtle, more hidden forms: it is the so-called hidden hunger, which is less evident, less impactful even as images that reach our eyes, to knowledge through NGOs and health workers. international cooperation, but which are equally negative and detrimental to the development of boys and girls. And therefore this phenomenon of hidden hunger is also among those that we want to address. We are mobilizing these days with renewed vigor precisely to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. And I really thank our president Linda McAvan and all my colleagues and shadow colleagues because around the re-proposal of this resolution we want to tell you that our commitment as Parliament is there, not only of the DEVE commission, but of the entire Parliament. We ask the Commission to take this step forward with equal effectiveness, with equal conviction. I really think that we should not have - I say this first of all to myself - the right to commemorate and celebrate if we do not accompany this right with a serious commitment, a measurable commitment (you spoke of numbers, figures and dates, and we appreciated it) and a commitment that also looks at effectiveness in its use. We know that the resources allocated to international development, like other resources within the Union, are not always used effectively, but here we cannot afford to lose anything. So this dimension of monitoring effectiveness, of understanding what happens to our plans, also becomes absolutely essential. So I believe we must make these commitments with renewed vigor. You spoke about these plans, you also spoke about the need to carry out an evaluation of the effectiveness to see how to reprogram the interventions. Here, I ask you to maintain a very collaborative and very engaging relationship with Parliament throughout this process because you will find, as you have seen, in the commission great skills and great passion and therefore a great desire to collaborate in developing the most effective measures . Many things have been done – Linda McAvan cited some results, she cited them – and I think that Europe should be proud of having contributed to these results. However, the phenomenon is returning in certain geographical areas and places where it did not exist due to the economic crisis, due to speculation on the prices of food, of essential food products. Therefore we also ask you to involve your colleagues for a vision of a slightly more horizontal and all-round policy to trace the causes of some of these phenomena which can be tackled perhaps in other sectors, with a different agricultural policy, for example, with a different commercial policy, with a financial policy. This phenomenon of commodity speculation on food is something – I believe – intolerable for the common opinion of this Parliament. Finally, a final observation: we have all seen, by reading and documenting ourselves, not only for this occasion but for our work, how the role of women is fundamental. There are data that make you shudder: women contribute 80% of food production in developing countries and are 60% of the malnourished; they contribute to producing and being the real farmers, and have 2% of the ownership. Here we also make politics towards women, who are an element of development in many countries, not only in the West we know.\n",

In my country, in Galicia, there are more than 20% of children below the poverty level. In the Spanish State, today, 60% more people are at risk of poverty and social exclusion than in 2007.

I am also very pleased - a big thank you to Mrs McAvan - that in this report we are not just talking about malnutrition, but also about malnutrition, because it is not enough for children to get enough calories. For healthy growth and age-appropriate development, they need a balanced diet with vitamins and trace elements, to name just a few. However, we will not achieve this if we continue to promote the usual monocultures. They displace diversified cultivation systems with different types of grain and vegetables and thus also the production of the required micronutrients. I here call on the EU to follow the recommendations of the EU Special Rapporteur on the right to food, who explicitly identifies more organic agriculture as a way for these countries to feed themselves, and who also refers to the role of agriculture in climate change and poverty alleviation. It is therefore important to promote and support small farmers because they have the potential to spread diverse climate-friendly farming systems, they have the potential to produce fair food that corresponds to local dietary habits, they have the potential to create an economy to build. Because primary production is also linked to processing, transport and trade in the region. This is where the potential for workers lies and therefore the first step out of poverty. But without land, food cannot be grown. This means that traditional land rights must be protected and access to land must be ensured for the local population, especially women. The winner here cannot be the one who puts more money on the table. The local population must be the winner here, and we must under no circumstances encourage further land grabbing. Investments in agriculture are absolutely necessary. They are necessary if we want to combat hunger and poverty in developing countries. But not every type of investment in agriculture is helpful here. If private investors end up driving the local population more or less away from their own resources and depriving them of them in order to carry out this essential food production themselves, in order to produce large margins for the world market, for international markets, then no child will be fed up. Trade agreements must also take this into account in the future, they must also do justice to this. Otherwise, these countries will become more and more dependent on the international raw material markets and on the fluctuations in prices on these markets. They become dependent on food speculation, and stock market developments therefore become decisive in determining whether a child can go to bed hungry or full at the end of the day. This is extremely immoral and we have to fight against it. Poverty and hunger can be prevented by providing sufficient support to local farmers. This is the only way for these countries to achieve food sovereignty. We need further greening of farming systems to adapt them to climate change, because it is precisely these countries that will be the first to be affected by climate change. Both are basic elements in the fight against poverty and hunger.\n",

Of these, 225 million children are under the age of 5 and are chronically malnourished. Technological progress has made it possible, among other things, to have food for everyone, but despite this, children still die of hunger and are still malnourished. It is a scandal, as Pope Francis called it, whose messages I hope we have not only listened to and quickly forgotten, but have accepted and supported with our long applause in this House. So there is food for all, but no justice for all. That's why this week we passed the Resolution on a new global framework for development and we asked the European Union and the international community to focus on the causes of poverty and hunger. And in this Resolution of colleague McAvan, it is clearly mentioned what those causes are, and there are more of them. But, in short, if we are going to reason following the Pope's messages, then we have to conclude that the main causes of poverty and hunger are actually selfish human behaviors and policies that have only material interests at their center, and those of the strongest, and ignore the dignity of human life in its entire duration. Yes, as a Christian Democrat I will emphasize that the issue of child malnutrition shows that the dignity of human life must be protected from the very beginning. As stated in paragraph 3 of this Resolution, the first 1000 days of a child's life are the most important, including the period of pregnancy. However, it is not enough to say that we want to protect life from the beginning, it is also necessary, through an effective coherent development policy, to enable that child when he is born to have quality nutrition, access to health care, education, and we all have to work much harder on this together. In this regard, I welcome the Commission's intention to invest EUR 3.5 billion, as well as the intention of the commissioner who said that he wants strict monitoring for the implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of these programs. And I also expect that the Council in December will support the goal of this Parliament for the complete eradication of hunger, the so-called Zero Hunger Goal.\n",

To achieve this, Brussels' agricultural policy must be drastically reformed and we must stop providing our own farmers with 363 billion euros in agricultural subsidies, we must stop dumping agricultural surpluses in developing countries. However, the best measure is simple and cheap: our consumption pattern. We need to eat less meat! Every five seconds a child dies of hunger.

UNICEF, for example, has taken this issue very seriously and taken action on it. Indeed, as the commissioner says, the EU can also act through UN organizations to promote this issue. It is largely a question of the fact that there has also been a shift to more one-sided farming. Because of this, the Greens have presented an amendment that emphasizes the importance of an agroecological approach. That has also been the message of the UN special rapporteur. Namely, it gives opportunities for more versatile farming, which in turn means that specifically mothers who are farmers in Africa can offer more versatile nutrition to children, which is absolutely necessary for their development. I would also like to draw attention to an issue that my colleague Michel also addressed, i.e. land grabbing. We should be able to study how the European Union's free trade agreements with developing countries actually affect the fact that large companies are increasingly taking over large farming areas from the governments of developing countries, which in turn reduce the opportunities for small farmers. We would like an investigation into this. The World Agricultural Organization FAO has drawn up good codes of conduct for this matter, the Voluntary Guidelines, and I hope that they will gradually become binding, so that the needs of poor people, the majority of the world, are really taken into account and not sacrificed to big companies.\n",

Great progress has been made towards achieving one of the Millennium Development Goals, namely halving the rate of undernourished people in developing countries. However, the problem has not disappeared, it is ubiquitous and complicated. I therefore support the content of the draft resolution. The leading cause of malnutrition among children in all regions of the world is poverty. The most difficult situation is in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. According to UNICEF data, approximately 100 million children worldwide suffer from malnutrition, and over 50 million children under the age of five suffer from hunger. However, as many as 160 million children around the world suffer from short stature. Malnutrition hinders a child's physical development, weakens his or her intellect, ability to concentrate and learn, and consequently deprives him or her of the chance to be independent in the future, find a good job and break the cycle of poverty in which he or she grows up. Therefore, in the report on the global development framework after 2015, which was passed yesterday by a large majority, MEP Davor Stier mentioned combating poverty and, therefore, hunger and malnutrition among children as the most important goal. As a member of the DEVE committee, I would like to emphasize the particular need to help developing countries by supporting their actual development, which will enable them to be self-sufficient in the future. We cannot refuse emergency help, especially in extreme cases where not only children but their entire families suffer from hunger. Malnutrition is particularly dangerous for pregnant women because it can cause significant damage or impede the development of the fetus. Well-nourished children are hope for future generations, they are healthier and learn better. Thanks to this, they have a chance to provide themselves and others with decent living conditions in the future. Meanwhile, in the world today, every 5/6 seconds - as we already know - one child dies. Together we can change this.\n",

Two billion people in the world suffer from hidden hunger; millions of children suffer from extreme hunger leading to death. More than ever we must be aware that something needs to be done on a global scale so that children have not only enough food but a balanced diet. There are also pregnant women, who are suffering from hunger, with the painful and permanent consequences, which this brings on their babies. Therefore we must also focus on these women and on the babies - especially in the first 1000 days where their development is so crucial. One of the solutions for this is education. Education gives an important job and economic growth potential to fight hunger and poverty, to have a sustainable development and an improvement in the social situation. Learning about food and nutrition should be an integral part of formal education, so that we grow a healthy generation capable of living in a dignified way. An investment in this sense is an investment in the future; investment in people who are able to find work to survive themselves and support their families.

I am very happy to note that in the United Nations proposal for the new post-2015 Development Agenda, one of the goals is to end all forms of malnutrition by the year 2030, focusing on children. But we must open our field of vision more to achieve our goal and eradicate child malnutrition.

Thus, before the age of five, little girls are three times more likely than little boys to suffer from severe malnutrition. Deprived of good nutritional conditions and therefore even more vulnerable to growth problems, girls are more likely to die when they are still very young. It is therefore appropriate to identify cultural and religious obstacles in discriminatory practices and attitudes harmful to girls, and obviously try to remedy them. Furthermore, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, if women farmers had access to the same means of production as men, they could increase yields worldwide by 20 to 30% and increase the agricultural production for food purposes. In other words, these advances would prevent 100 million people, or even 150 million, from going hungry. Consequently, fighting against inequalities between men and women and between girls and boys from a very young age, putting an end to the unfavorable treatment of little girls, improving the prospects of women farmers, these are concrete areas for fighting against malnutrition of children in developing countries.

Currently 805 million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy life, most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa and also in Asia. One in nine people in the world is in this situation.

It is true that the European Union has made an important effort in all development cooperation issues, but we still must do more to be able to alleviate this problem, with innovative financing, but also with long-term financing.

Incidents of children fainting in Greek schools due to hunger are frequent. The only solution, Commissioner, is to abolish the memorandums and reverse the policy of austerity.\n",

Years and years of insufficient investment in agriculture, the promotion of agricultural abandonment, the liquidation of family farming and small and medium-sized farms, a sector that ensures the subsistence of 70% of the planet's poor populations. Market fundamentalism, privatization and liberalization policies, free trade, have had and are resulting in the abandonment of land, the concentration of its ownership, the dominance of production by a few and the food dependence of many. Hunger and malnutrition are a lively accusatory libel that weighs on an unjust, exploitative, oppressive system – for this reason historically condemned. It is regrettable, but enlightening, that the question that launches this debate addresses child malnutrition as a profitable investment for donors. The fight against malnutrition is, indeed, an ethical duty, indispensable, and above all else a question of justice.\n",

And there has been a lot of analysis about it here, but I want to add one reason myself, that one worrying problem in Africa, for example, is the so-called land grabbing phenomenon, i.e. rich Arab countries and multinational companies buy agricultural land, because they know that the earth does not grow, but the cultivated area more and more is needed, and when they get hold of these lands, they also dictate what is produced, how it is produced, and in this way small farms suffer and that partly leads to the depression of the agricultural sector in Africa. Isn't this colonialism, actually neo-colonialism at its worst? I think the Commission needs to take this land grabbing seriously in its Africa policy.

And ensuring the right to food and nutrition can only be achieved through reducing poverty, ensuring sufficient income for families, and eliminating huge social inequality. Unfortunately, children in developing countries suffer the most from hunger and deprivation. As I mentioned, child abuse is related to lack of food and family poverty, exclusion, inadequate care and feeding practices, inadequate health care services. Child poverty in developing countries is not only caused by food shortages and inadequate infrastructure, but also by food distribution problems, unequal access to food and insufficient purchasing power, especially given high food prices, which are further inflated by speculation. It is painful that today's reality is that in some countries we talk about how to reduce food waste, while in others we count children dying of hunger.

In addition child nutrition can be linked to the education, or lack thereof, of the mother and also needs to be addressed in future policy. While the Commission has in fact earmarked EUR 3.5 billion between 2014 and 2020 to improving nutrition in some of the world’s poorest countries, I would encourage the Commission to scale up its commitments as regards nutrition-specific interventions in order to meet its objective of reducing by 7 million the number of stunted children under the age of five by 2025.\n",

The Commission's proposal to amend the 2003 Regulation in this area concerns the possibility for member states to restrict or even prohibit the use of genetically modified food products and feed on their territory, subject to maintaining an authorization system at EU level. Applying these changes, however, would create legal uncertainty regarding the practical application of the measures proposed by the Commission, fragment the internal market and distort competition, contravene the principles of good regulation and transparency, and could limit the free movement of goods within the EU . In this context, it is clear that we need an impact assessment of these measures, but above all a series of scientific opinions of the European Food Safety Authority, which assess the risks to human health, animal health and environmental protection. I believe that the position of the Commission for the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is well founded and I support the adoption of the report, in the sense of rejecting the Commission's proposal.\n",

In terms of the consequences on EU agricultural sector, the proposal will have a direct negative impact on it.

If countries are not given such an opportunity, then, taking into account the interests of large food producers and importers, countries at the EU level have not succeeded in agreeing on the prohibition of GMO food until now and will not succeed in the future, no matter how critical and cautious the attitude of consumers is.

Looking at the data, it can be seen that 36.3% of the petitions were taken into consideration while 63.7% were closed because the signatories continue to confuse national competences with those of the European Union, as well as the EU institutions with the Council of Europe or with the Court of Human Rights. This shows that more work needs to be done to better inform citizens about the right to petition and what they can achieve by exercising that right before the European Parliament.\n",

The fact that 1,431 petitions were received in 2015, representing a decrease of 47% compared to 2014, during which Parliament received 2,714 petitions, confirms the lack of information among European citizens about the existence of this right.

The year 2015 was the first full year of the five-year legislative period that began in 2014, and tangible changes were made in PETI's work by streamlining the handling of petitions. All of this led to the fact that the old, forgotten or believed to be lost petitions were put on the agenda, the committee decided on the topics written in them and sent an answer to the EU citizens. The processing of newly received petitions is no longer hindered by the large number of previously accumulated petitions. The development of an internet portal designed for the electronic submission of petitions contributed to EU citizens becoming more familiar with the possibilities provided by the right of petition. The good functioning of PETI is an important trust factor, the faith of EU citizens in EU institutions depends a lot on its work.

The working schedule of the Petitions Committee does not correspond to the legislative program of the European Commission, but is shaped by the citizens themselves. Annual statistics for 2015 show that the European Parliament received 1,431 petitions. Most citizens ask for help in the field of environment, justice, internal market or fundamental rights. The rapporteur states in the report that the biggest problem is that citizens do not receive sufficiently reasoned answers in which their petitions are declared inadmissible, as well as cases of delays by the committee in handling petitions. I consider the right of petition to be an important right of every citizen to turn to the European Parliament, e.g. in cases of insufficient application of European regulations by a member state or non-compliance with Community regulations.

PETI can do considerable work to explain and eventually prove the successes and benefits of the European project. In 2015 there was greater speed and efficiency in the processing of petitions. The main issues addressed are environmental legislation, violations of fundamental rights, application of justice (in particular, custody rights in relation to minors), rights of children, people with disabilities and minorities, free movement of people, discrimination, immigration, employment and animal welfare. Petitions can be a useful tool for citizen engagement. However, its reach is limited and, in practice, it has been more of a democratic adornment than a true tool for popular mobilization. This will not be how the EU's democratic deficit will be resolved.\n",

      "\tI supported the report on the activities of the Committee for Petitions for 2015. This report gave us an overview of the activities of the PETI Committee, simple statistics, but also highlighted the strengths of the petitions hearing and pointed out the weaknesses. I decided to support the report mainly because the petition is a unique tool through which the citizens of the European Union can address their concerns and problems. I think that petitions help people to get more involved in public life and also strengthen the awareness that the European authorities are interested in solving their problems addressed in the petitions. I really appreciate that the inhabitants of the European Union are actively solving problems related to the protection of the environment, the protection of consumer rights and justice. It is also a very positive change that the processing time for the petition has been reduced, as well as that an internet portal has been created through which petitions can be filed and monitored electronically. Overall, I consider the annual report to be well composed and understandable.\n",

The purpose of the annual report for 2015 is to provide insight into the overall work of the Committee on Petitions. The report provides statistical data on the number of petitions received, processed or concluded by the Board, the countries covered and the issues addressed. The right to petition should strengthen the ability of the European Parliament to act, helping to solve problems mainly related to the application of EU legislation. Through petitions, the impact of EU legislation on the daily life of European citizens can be assessed, while strengthening the ability of the European Parliament to act can help solve problems mainly related to the implementation of EU legislation, because petitions represent a valuable source of information for identifying deficiencies in the implementation of EU legislation. And. I support Parliament's request to the Commission for greater engagement with the European Citizens Initiative so that the initiative develops its full potential and functions. The Committee on Petitions has the opportunity and challenge, after the latest events in the United Kingdom, to hold a dialogue with citizens, because it has the potential to reunite the institutions and citizens of the European Union, putting citizens at the center of the European project and showing them the positive impact of EU policies.\n",

      "\tMr President, President Michel, Vice—President Šefčovič, welcome back to the European Parliament. The decision of the European Council to grant candidate status to Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova and to offer this perspective to Georgia, once it fulfils the conditions, was correct. This is a decision supported by the European Parliament and it corresponds to the expectations of the people in these countries. The people of Ukraine are defending European values with their lives in Ukraine and the people of Moldova have opened their houses to Ukrainian refugees. More Ukrainian refugees have entered the Republic of Moldova in relation to its population than any EU Member State. We, as the European Parliament, have understood early that we can only live in safety and security within the borders of the European Union if the countries in our immediate neighbourhood borders are safe and stable. This is why we called already in March for Ukraine, and in May for the Republic of Moldova, to work towards granting this candidate status. Because in these times we have to act quickly, clearly without hesitation. Dear colleagues, Members of the Parliament, thank you very much for the fact that Parliament stood united since the beginning of this war in supporting countries in our eastern neighbourhood. Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova still have a long way to go before they are ready for EU membership but, Vice-President Šefčovič, we have to make sure that we start this process at a technical level and we have to make sure that even before these countries are ready to join, we support them and we make sure that the people in these countries can start feeling the benefits of getting closer to the European Union. The Council made the right decisions on Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, but the outcome on Western Balkans was disappointing. I was encouraged, President Michel, by your remarks today, and I believe we all have to work together so that we make sure that the Czech Presidency succeeds where the French Presidency has not managed to succeed, in offering a clear perspective to the Western Balkan countries. Good news came from the European Council when it comes to the euro area. Thank you, President Michel, for endorsing Croatia’s readiness to become a member of the euro area on 1 January. We have yesterday voted with a large majority here to approve Croatia’s entry into the euro area on 1 January. Every single member of the four largest groups in the European Parliament, and many colleagues in the other groups, have voted in favour. So thank you very much dear colleagues, this shows us that Croatia’s path on strengthening its economy, on managing its budget with care, on getting closer to the euro area under the leadership of Prime Minister Andrej Plenković, was correct. It pays off. It is good news for Croatia. It is good news for the euro area. It will make the euro area stronger and it shows the trust in our common currency. Last point, it is our duty, dear colleagues, to further strengthen the European Union. We have to equip the European Union with the tools it needs to overcome the problems that people are facing. We held the Conference on the Future of Europe but, President Michel, the outcome of the European Council saying that ‘we take note of this and we are happy that there was an exchange with citizens’ is too little. We have to take the ideas of the citizens on board. We have to solve their problems and we have to do this together. Council, Commission and Members of the European Parliament, we have to make the EU fit for the future. We have to make sure that it can make decisions, it can react fast, and it offers solutions to the problems that people are facing.\n",

      "\tMr President, honourable colleagues, we could describe the conclusions of the last European Council as having both bright spots and shadows. The progress on accession requests is certainly positive. The European Union is the home of democracy. We are the institution to which more and more countries look for stability, security, and peace. The shadows, however, are what we still see concerning energy and economic issues, particularly regarding the security of gas supplies and the fight against inflation – issues that simply must have a European response. The Council's conclusions, although urging the Commission to urgently continue efforts to ensure energy supply at affordable prices, effectively postpone the decision to set a European price cap on gas, which could immediately curb the inflation that is also affecting essential goods. Despite the fear among some that Russia might react to a price cap with retaliations, it should be remembered that Putin is already cutting supplies precisely to prevent Europe from filling its storage facilities and thereby increasing the blackmail against us in the winter months, when we will need gas the most. Therefore, we must act now by diversifying supplies, with massive investments in renewable energy, immediately setting a European price cap on gas, and helping families and businesses caught in the vice-grip of high bills, expensive fuel, and inflation, in a context where we are still not out of the pandemic. Time is running out; we do not need European Councils that postpone decisions, but a united and solidary Union that can provide concrete and effective responses.\n",

The war Russia is waging against Ukraine is one against European integration, and we must stand together. We do regret, however, the lack of progress towards the Western Balkans. While the countries joining, we know, have to undertake tough democratic reforms, the job is not theirs alone. But where the European Council is disappointing a growing number of European citizens, President Michel, is when it comes to the debate on the future of the EU. While Parliament has already called for the establishment of a new Convention, the Council conclusions invite the institutions to follow up on the debates of the citizens only within their competences and within the current Treaties, which basically means the EUCO seems to have ruled out Treaty change and a new Convention. It’s a big disappointment. A big disappointment that the French Presidency did not move forward the process of amending the Treaties, as requested by this House. Furthermore, in the programme we just discussed with the Czech Presidency, we only see a vague reference to continuing the debate. President Michel, Europe may be ready to send a political signal for new members, and this is very much welcome, but the Council does not seem ready to address the issue of internal reform to make such commitment a real success.

      "\tMr President, Mr President of the Council, the last European Council concluded a French Presidency of the European Union which, beyond the all too often narcissistic exercise of a president fleeing electoral campaigns and French debates, will in no way have remedied the inherent weaknesses and failings of Brussels. \"We must move towards a powerful Europe in the world, fully sovereign, free in its choices and master of its destiny,\" Emmanuel Macron modestly announced six months ago. Never, perhaps, have we been further from it. We will certainly have a universal charger, which is far from useless in everyday life. But what does that represent in light of the increased dependence on the Americans and NATO in matters of defence and foreign policy? For having failed to maintain military means commensurate with the world's challenges and dangers, Europe is forced to place its destiny in the hands of others. This is the very negation of sovereignty and freedom. Instead of striving to consolidate and repair what should be, the European Union continues its headlong rush by making enlargement a dogma, even if it means destabilizing our economic and social models. Hypocrisy regarding ecology and the environment continues unabated, and the French Presidency of the European Union took advantage of its last days to make a nice gift to commercial disorder by signing a new free trade agreement with New Zealand. Finally, despite recurrent posturing, Emmanuel Macron will not have achieved any significant progress in protecting our borders against migratory intrusions from the South and the East. Drawing on 3,000 years of history, the European states and peoples deserve better than the ineffective incantations of heads of state seeking to evade the popular will.\n",

And undoubtedly, the European Council's decision to grant Ukraine candidate status for EU membership is one of the most important decisions the European Council has taken recently. And it is good that this has happened. We hope that this process will progress quickly and that Ukraine will constantly have the support of the European Union, because both the Union and Ukraine itself need it. We also hope that this opportunity will very quickly be extended to other countries applying for membership in the European Union, primarily the Western Balkan countries. And the second issue I want to draw attention to, and which has also been mentioned here, concerns the fact that it seems, from our perspective, the most significant issue for Europeans right now – apart from security, apart from the war ongoing in Ukraine – is the energy crisis, which could affect all European families, linked to high energy prices, a lack of energy sources, and high inflation. And perhaps, Mr President, it would be worthwhile for a European Council summit to convene in the near future, even in an extraordinary session, to address these two topics that are so important for Europeans.\n",

      "\tMr President, Mr President of the Council, I'm going to be frank. Today I want to talk to you about the elephant in the room that everyone wants to forget: the change to the European treaties. Yes, it was indeed on the agenda of the last Council, I checked. But poof! In the discussions, a little magic trick, the subject seemed to have disappeared. Yet, our Parliament had been very clear about its expectations on the matter. The citizens consulted within the framework of the Conference on the Future of Europe had been just as clear: they expect a radical change to the very foundations of the European Union. What about Emmanuel Macron, who paraded around telling anyone who would listen that a change to the treaties was necessary, a proposal he has since buried – certainly since the elections in France passed? The European Heads of State tell us – and I quote the Council conclusions – that they \"take note of the citizens' demands\". That's nice, but since you simultaneously refuse to debate changing the treaties, I have the feeling that you are mostly taking citizens for fools. And if I summarise, we congratulate citizens who want to change the European Union from top to bottom; but on the other hand, we must be serious: everyone must come home, the party's over, not a comma of the European treaties will be touched. We have been warning since the beginning of the Conference on the Future of Europe that yet another parody of democracy would be very poorly received by citizens, who are tired of being disdained. And yet, that is exactly what is happening. Not only is treaty reform put off until the Greek calends, but moreover the EU is more stubborn than ever in its neoliberal business as usual. I'll give an example: last week, bingo! Another new free trade agreement, this time with New Zealand. A brilliant idea, indeed: ecological dumping, imports from the other side of the planet, our farmers in danger. Bravo, keep it up! And why stop there? What if we were to accelerate the return of austerity and the infamous 3% rule in the midst of a crisis? What if we were to insist even more on competition rules to privatise our trains and public services? What if we were to let an independent central bank, without any democratic control, hold the destiny of 450 million citizens in its hands, who will directly pay the consequences of its decisions? I reiterate forcefully here: the crises we are going through confirm more than ever the need to profoundly modify the current European rules. Our Parliament must take up the issue, demand accountability, put the subject on the table. We, here in the European Parliament, are the only elected representatives within the European institutions. So, let the Council be warned: we will not cease to demand that the voice of citizens be respected.\n",

Granting candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova was the right decision; it is a major, an important milestone. We in Parliament were the first to call for this, and continuing to support Ukraine and Moldova, as provided for, is absolutely correct. However, it is unacceptable that the Western Balkan states have had to wait so long for EU accession talks and that we have ultimately made no progress whatsoever. I believe we lost a great deal of trust in this region at the last summit. How can it be that the EU is still making North Macedonia wait after 15 years? How can it be that accession talks with Albania have been repeatedly postponed, even though Albania has had candidate status since 2010? Far too little has happened there, and the problem, of course, is unanimity in the Council. That is precisely where we must begin, and that is why it was right that we called for the establishment of a Convention, in order to finally bring about treaty changes and to finally move away from unanimity for major, important decisions, especially foreign policy issues.

You have long since buried Maastricht, the important question of budgetary discipline. You have long since buried Schengen and Dublin, where anyone can travel freely within this European Union and enter it without proper control mechanisms. And now the Copenhagen criteria, with Ukraine and Moldova being granted candidate status. It's similar with the sanctions policy: six packages that have been imposed, and the fact that the sanctioned party is then far less affected than those who impose the sanctions. Because the sanctioned party sells oil and gas to India and China and sells it back to us at a high price.

I wanted to say to him that he informed us here that he has prepared a European political community. I wanted to remind him that, historically, the European Union must be an economic community. And what are we doing about it: for the people of the European Union, for the states that have fallen behind, for the regions that need more cohesion, for citizens? What are we doing about the food crisis? What are we doing about the energy crisis? And I also wanted to ask the President: what is happening in the Netherlands? My country received an unfair resolution. In the Netherlands, I see that governments have deployed law enforcement and are shooting at farmers, those farmers who provide us with our food in the European Union. But, unfortunately, we have no one to turn to. Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I ask you to inform the President, and I want an answer. Do we have a single union or not? Will my country also be part of Schengen, or not?\n",

In June’s conclusion of the European Council, there was another call on Turkey to respect international law and terminate its unilateral and aggressive actions in the Eastern Mediterranean. However, I would like everyone to remember that in March 2021, the statement of the European Council – I am reading straight from it – stated, ‘we call on Turkey to abstain from renewed provocations or unilateral actions in breach of international law.’ Would you affirm the determination of the European Union, in case of such actions, to use the instruments and options at its disposal to defend its interests and those of its Member States? My final word: we stand with international law against Putin’s aggressive actions in Ukraine. We stand with the values of the European Union and we expect everyone to respect the values that are being violated in the Eastern Mediterranean against Cyprus and against Greece by a Turkish aggressive regime.

But, above all, in the short term, we have to win the narrative against Putin, who blames Europeans for food shortages in Africa and global price increases. Finally, we regret that the issue of migration is not included in the Council Conclusions, despite there not being a second to lose. Currently, there are five Regulations from 2022 and four pending from the previous legislative term, and it is essential that all of them advance so that we can finally achieve solidarity-based and effective border control. We must finally accept that the external borders of the European Union are those of a united Europe and that we must move towards a humanitarian dimension to the migration phenomenon.\n",

      "\tThe Council meeting of 23–24 June has fast-tracked EU candidate status for Ukraine and Moldova and closer status for Georgia. The speed used for granting this status is tied to the ongoing Russian invasion. However, the long-term political implications must be kept in mind. On the basis of prevailing rules, the process for these countries to attain membership will take years, perhaps decades. The underlying political rationale could fade or alter with time. Consider Turkey, where claiming that only this country has shown bad faith in its accession process is not tenable. Disillusionment or worse bitterness could eventually colour the relationship between the EU and accession aspirants. As has happened with the EU’s candidacy outreach to the Balkan states. On a more fundamental basis, the EU needs to face out the strategic question that old-timer Henry Kissinger has clearly defined: post Putin and post the EU’s current leaders, Europe will still have to define what relationship it wants with Russia. Does it want Russia as a full partner in a European system or would it like Russia as an Asian power to be held at arm’s length? Mitterrand and de Gaulle also raised the question and their concerns were side-lined. How sad and short-sighted. PRESIDENZA: ROBERTA METSOLA President\n",

      "\tMr. President, on behalf of the majority force in Parliament, I want to congratulate you, President Sassoli, and wish you the best of luck. You have had our votes; I only ask that you do not forget this now or in two and a half years. I also want to congratulate and thank President Tajani, who has always defended the honour and dignity of this Parliament and all its members. Furthermore, I must congratulate both new and veteran colleagues. The responsibility of representing the European people rests on our shoulders. We are the only institution elected by the European people. The one I am not going to congratulate is the Council. With all due respect, President Tusk, you cannot boast about how you have done things, neither in terms of your methods, nor your vetoes, nor your lack of respect for the other institutions. To the extremists — I don't know if they are here today — who last Tuesday turned their backs on the anthem of Europe, I also want to say that we will never turn our backs on the anthem of the United Kingdom. That is the difference between having principles and not having them. Today I speak here on behalf of a deeply pro-European political Group, which has helped build Europe from its foundations; the Group of a founding party of the European Union; a Group that, unlike others, will always be willing to make concessions and sacrifices to reach agreements; a Group proud of its president and the winning candidate in the last European elections, Manfred Weber. Manfred, you have our support! Without intending to, today he represents the spirit of European democracy in the face of the Council. Europe, in addition to appearing democratic, must be democratic. That is why this House has defended the Spitzenkandidat process for years; because we believe that Europeans have the right not only to vote on how they are governed, but also on who governs them. And I tell you one thing: we believed in the Spitzenkandidat yesterday, we believe today, and I assure you that in five years we will continue to believe, because we prefer ballot boxes to closed rooms. The legitimate interests of the governments represented in the Council should not be imposed by the force of the States against the will of the citizens represented in this Parliament. At this point, I will tell you that the European People's Party will support the candidate proposed by the Council, out of responsibility, because she belongs to the political party that won the elections and because at the head of the Commission there will be a capable person ready to fight in defence of Europe's interests. As a political Group, we are also proud that Ursula von der Leyen will be the first woman to lead the European Union, and that she is, precisely, a woman of the centre-right. However, the Council and its candidate will have to negotiate a programme with this House. We invite the members of the Council to share a reflection. The future of Europe must stop being decided behind closed doors and in secret conspiracies. The Spitzenkandidat process is not about a man or a woman. It is about citizens being able to choose the person who governs them in Europe; a truly revolutionary idea: it is called democracy. The Council has the right to propose a candidate for President of the Commission to Parliament. That is true. But the Council does not have the right to ignore all the candidates who have been voted for by European citizens. You, Mr. Tusk, have formed a top leadership of the European Union that excludes Eastern Europe. No one from Eastern Europe is in your package of names. You, Mr. Tusk, have vetoed — yes, vetoed — the candidate for whom more than forty million Europeans voted, the same population as your country or mine. You have vetoed him. You have imposed the structure of the Commission on the candidate for President of the Commission. Not only the structure — even how many vice-presidencies she will have — without consulting her and before Parliament votes on her, which clearly goes against the Treaties. You have tried to tell Parliament who they should appoint as President of the House, and even for how long the Groups should divide the Presidency among themselves. You have gone as far as deciding who will be the president of the European Central Bank as if it were just another political position. That is called poor democratic education. You have proven the Eurosceptics right. Governing from the capitals is also nationalism. None of the presidents who are part of the Council would dare to do in their respective countries what they have done in the Council, because the Constitutional Court would prevent them. If you'll allow me a joke, you are lucky that Article 7 of the Treaty cannot be applied to the Council, because if it could, today, the Commission would have a real problem. You have opened a very serious political conflict between the Council and Parliament over who decides in Europe. And I will tell you one thing: my parliamentary Group is among those who believe that in Europe, the people decide.\n",

      "\tMr President, honourable Members, in the May elections, European citizens sent us a clear message: they trust Europe, but they want change, and I can assure you that my political Group has the commitment and responsibility to drive that change. The person who would have best led that change in the Commission would undoubtedly have been Frans Timmermans. Firstly, due to his status as Spitzenkandidat, who can obtain a majority of votes in this European Parliament, and out of respect for the democratic rules we establish for ourselves. And secondly, and just as important, because our candidate was rejected for defending the values of the Union and the rule of law. Let it be very clear that we will work with renewed energy to ensure those values are respected. But there is an important issue in politics that is also fundamental, and that is consistency. And it is not consistent to come here to tear down the Council's decision and then say that one will vote in favour of it. The truth is, that position is not very consistent. But let us be clear about one thing: the fundamental principle underpinning the European Union is human dignity. And if we were consistent with those values, we would have acted decisively and coordinately long ago to discuss politics in Europe; to discuss how we can respect human rights; to see how we can ensure that the fundamental values of the Union are respected. We must go further. I want to talk about politics and I want to talk about how this Group will lead the changes in Europe. I am glad that the Italian courts have released Captain Carola Rackete. This happens when, indeed, there is separation of powers, and that is why it is essential to preserve the separation of powers against illiberal democracies. But we must go further and prevent these dramatic situations from occurring due to a lack of solidarity in the European Union. It is indecent to criminalise those who save lives and it is indecent to try to gain political advantage from the misfortune of these people. Speaking of politics, and speaking of substance, we will also not support any candidate who intends to remain static in the face of the need for reforms in economic governance, the strengthening of social policies, and ecological transformation. The clock is not waiting. European teenagers tell us this every Friday. Let us act in the face of the global climate emergency; let us not disappoint them. That is why we will be very demanding with the agenda of the next Commission. Climate change demands a transformation that must have two pillars: inclusion, to ensure a just transition, and sustainability. We were disappointed to see the lack of unanimity in fulfilling our commitments adopted in Paris. This Parliament has always been ahead, and our Group will continue to build majorities to urge the Commission and the Council to be more ambitious. And in this regard, I must congratulate the Finnish Presidency of the Council for its proposals for a sustainable future. We continue to talk about politics. We need an ambitious multiannual financial framework to bring about the necessary change; we cannot do more with less. And this Parliament will fight to secure the funds required by the policies we are going to adopt. Do you remember Europe 2020? Well, there are six months left and we have not been able to meet the objectives, to reduce the number of people at risk of poverty and exclusion. Out of twenty million, we have only achieved five. Because while some benefit from the crisis, others continue to pay its consequences, and grand figures are not enough for us. We are interested in people, and we want economic growth to translate into people, the men and women of Europe, being able to live better lives with more social justice. We must change economic governance. We want a social and solidarity economy, and for that, it is necessary to strengthen the European Semester, so that it includes the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the pillar of social rights. And we also need to reform the monetary union. We cannot wait for another crisis to reform the Eurozone, to provide it with fiscal capacity and a deposit guarantee. But we will not be able to achieve these objectives if we do not also work on a global agenda. We want a strong Europe, to promote human rights, labour, and environmental standards in multilateral agreements. Citizens expect more from us: they expect us to defend social achievements, such as sexual and reproductive rights or the rights of the LGBTI community; to continue making progress so that unjust situations like the gender pay gap are ended once and for all. And, of course, it is in our hands to end the greatest social scourge currently affecting Europe, which is gender-based violence, women who continue to be murdered simply for being women. And, of course, because we are here to provide answers now, we cannot wait any longer. We are here to build a strong Europe based on the values of equality, solidarity, sustainability, and justice, and we will work hand in hand with anyone who defends these objectives. Let us not betray the trust of those who have placed it in us.\n",

      "\tMr President, I would like to congratulate you and all the other colleagues who have been elected to the leadership of Parliament these days. I can only express my hope that, together with the new 'Renew Europe' group, we will make the voice of this Parliament heard more. For this voice to be heard more, we primarily need a democratisation of the appointment process for leadership positions in the European Union. These proposals must start from here, because otherwise we can discuss names, we can discuss gender balance, we can discuss geographical balance, but as long as we don't have a democratic and transparent process for electing those who are to lead Europe, we cannot be satisfied. Yes, this time we have some proposals. The colleagues who preceded me in their interventions have expressed their opinions regarding how these individuals were selected. We do not have balance, Mr President, we certainly do not have geographical balance. Eastern Europe, unfortunately, is no longer represented as it was when you were appointed to the position you currently hold. Therefore, we need a way to take into account everything stipulated by the Treaty on European Union, and these things must be translated into a democratic process. Dear Popular and Socialist colleagues, if we truly want a democratic spirit and if we want these lead candidates to be truly representative, let us consider how we can establish a system of transnational electoral lists or lists through which these candidates can be accessible to all European citizens, not just German citizens, not just French or Spanish or Dutch citizens, and so on. These 'Spitzenkandidaten' will be legitimate when every European citizen has access to them and can vote for them. We propose that we do this, and that we start it here in Parliament, because we cannot expect either the Commission or the Council to do something that is our responsibility. The 'Renew Europe' group proposes to you, and will propose to both the Council and Parliament, that we organize a European conference, a conference for the renewal of Europe, for the democratisation of the electoral process, a conference of a sufficiently long duration – two years, two and a half years – which would make proposals together with the Commission, with the Council, with citizens, with non-governmental organisations, to come up with proposals on how we can improve the process we have. I fully agree with Mr González Pons, I fully agree with Iratxe García Pérez that we need people who truly represent Europeans and from whom the Council can then choose. But let's formalise this process, so that we no longer waste time arguing with exchanges of ideas and opinions when it's already too late, when the Council has to choose, and when we have to be able to decide! Let's use this mandate so that by the next elections we have such a mechanism already agreed with Parliament, with the Council, and with the Member States, and let's stop wasting time throwing insults at each other and show European citizens that we are capable of making decisions and capable of representing them! This is what we propose to you, I hope we will have your support, because we have time, from now until the next elections, to go through this process.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tSecondly, European values and the rule of law, respect for human rights, from our point of view and for us, are non-negotiable, and their violation means undermining democracy. That is why it is very important for us that in this legislative term we can discuss a set of legislative proposals for the protection of the rule of law and fundamental rights, and an effective mechanism that includes sanctions for all Member States; to have this very clear mechanism that plays primarily a preventive role, but also to know exactly what awaits each Member State that violates the rule of law and disrespects justice. Furthermore, we must conclude the process of appointing the European Prosecutor as quickly as possible. We have waited too long for this. This institution must be functional as soon as possible to protect the financial interests of the European Union from corruption and fraud, but, above all, to send a very clear signal that the European Union knows not only how to punish, but also how to prevent, and that European institutions have the tools to do so.\n",

      "\tThirdly, we need a new vision and policies that reconcile ecological imperatives with economic and social ones. We have a very clear agenda on climate change. We must be able to align it with our economic development objectives, and with our social development objectives. The message must be very clear for the future European Commission regarding these objectives that we also have in Parliament. In this context, the adoption of the new Strategic Agenda 2019-2024, which the Council adopted, is an important step, but it is not enough. From our point of view, we must have such a political agenda established here in the European Parliament. I hope we can continue and complete the process we started with the pro-European political groups in Parliament, through which we establish these priorities and can place them before the future leadership of the European Commission as quickly as possible. Parliament must play a key role in establishing these priorities, and we must do this now, before the appointment of the future President of the European Commission. Otherwise, we risk it being too late again. It is our responsibility, the responsibility of the pro-European political forces in this Parliament, to lay before the future European Commission the strategic priorities of Parliament. We must do this now, because European citizens expect a renewal of the way European politics is conducted, and this renewal must start here in Parliament.\n",

I was very moved ten years ago when I first sat in this chamber, moved by the emotion of collectively representing 500 million European citizens. While it is certainly relatively modest on a global scale – 7% – it is the first time humanity has attempted transnational democracy. Remember, on May 26th, 200 million Europeans participated in the election of our Parliament, the very seat of this first transnational democracy.\n",

      "\tIn the wake of the ballot, and to respond to the unprecedented citizen mobilisation, I found myself dreaming that political groups resolutely committed to European integration would decide to forge a project contract together. This project for change would have had no other goal than to find, in this chamber, a broad and stable majority to collectively address the triple environmental, social, and democratic emergency and, in doing so, demonstrate that the European Union works for the benefit of all. This agreement around a project contract would then have allowed the involved groups to designate a personality directly from the elections to embody it, as President of the European Commission.\n",

      "\tA solid and coherent project, a credible personality to embody it, all supported by a broad majority, including the political forces that won the elections. Faced with this, the European Council would have had no other choice but to accept, at the risk, otherwise, of clashing in a sterile confrontation with Parliament, a confrontation from which it would not have emerged victorious. In such a scenario, the European Parliament would have asserted, as never before, its capacity to be the primary democratic expression of the Union's citizens. It would also have provided an answer to the disillusionment with politics.\n",

      "\tThis, dear colleagues, is what the situation could have been at the opening of our first plenary session. It is for this scenario that the Greens/European Free Alliance group had been preparing for several months. It was with a view to achieving this that we committed ourselves unreservedly over the past weeks. Certainly, the challenge was enormous, and time was short, but where there is a will, as you know, there is a way. It is here, in the European Parliament itself, that this will was lacking.\n",

      "\tA majority in this Parliament has indeed preferred a path that will inevitably lead it to become the executor of decisions made elsewhere, in the European Council, unless, of course, the martial expressions I have heard to my left and right translate into action, but allow me, at this stage at least, to doubt it. A European Council, five days of inglorious haggling where partisan and national considerations took precedence over the project and its embodiment. All this to arrive at a cast whose ability to drive the change our societies need and our fellow citizens expect is questionable.\n",

      "\tAnd while it is legitimate – and I have heard it often in this chamber – to criticise the Heads of State and Government, I want to tell you all that if Parliament emerges weakened from this episode, it will first and foremost have to blame itself. I would like to thank President Tusk for the kind words he quite explicitly addressed to the political family I have the honour to lead here in the Council. I believe your words are sincere, but I must note that, around the Council table – and indeed, even here in this chamber – this willingness to associate the family of political ecology with the management of the next five years does not seem uniformly shared, and I think that is an understatement.\n",

      "\tBut all this does not temper our enthusiasm; strengthened by the renewed trust of our fellow citizens, we will not give up.

A Europe at the forefront of the fight for the preservation of our climate, biodiversity, and natural resources; a Europe championing the fight for social, fiscal, economic justice, and for gender equality; a Europe at the forefront of defending human rights and freedoms, and an ever more participatory democracy.

      "\tMr President, President Tusk, honourable colleagues, once again the European institutions have offered an undignified spectacle to the citizens. Anyone who, after the electoral campaign, after the elections of 26 May, had the slightest hope for a change in methods and programmes has been disappointed. The spectacle that has been offered and the interinstitutional clash we have seen unfold in recent days is truly something that European citizens will not be able to understand. The Council decided to throw a questionable method, which Parliament tried to defend, that of the lead candidate , into the bin, and today Parliament and the parliamentary groups complain that there was no respect in the package agreed between the Heads of State and Government. And here too, you demonstrate your hypocrisy and your lack of consistency in following up words with actions. If Parliament truly wants to be respected, if Parliament, or the majority in Parliament, truly wants to defend the lead candidate method, then words can be followed by actions. If you truly want to be consistent, you can vote against the candidate that the Council has proposed for the Presidency of the Commission. If you make such a gesture, you can be considered consistent. Otherwise, your words will remain, as always and as you have often demonstrated, mere words, proving once again that this Institution is worthless and has no say in European decisions.\n",

      "\tAs for the package proposed by the Council – and of course, we await the programmatic guidelines – the premises, as already stated, do not bode well for a significant change, the kind that European citizens asked us for on 26 May; they do not bode well for a change of direction that can resolve the problems European citizens are facing and where the majority, which has governed Europe until today, has profoundly failed. The economic crisis: today Europe is the continent that grows the least; it is a continent that is falling behind, and this is the consequence of reckless choices made by these institutions, which not only have not been able to help citizens but very often have exacerbated problems. The issue of internal security: those who were present in the last legislature had to experience two very serious attacks in the two seats of Parliament. Today our citizens are not able to move around our cities safely, and in this regard, these institutions have not been able to provide a response. And the third point concerns the management of migratory flows: as long as we are not able to protect our external borders, as long as we are not able to protect our citizens, these institutions will not only never find an agreement on how to redistribute those who have the right to enter Europe, but the risk is that this continent will be crushed by migratory flows that are unsustainable.\n",

We will continue to work to challenge the rhetoric of \"TINA\" (There Is No Alternative), what you propose to us every time to solve European problems, which is to give ever more powers to bureaucrats far removed from citizens. No, this is not the Europe that citizens want. This is not the Europe we want, and if you continue in this direction, Europe truly risks dissolution. The divergences between Member States and between institutions continue to widen, and we will not go in any direction.

      "\tMr President, congratulations and all the best. I think the most obvious conclusion that comes from the last Council is that the Spitzenkandidaten mechanism is dead. It is dead and gone. It’s even more dead than the parrot in the Monty Python sketch. I’m not sorry that it is dead because, look, there is nothing about Spitzenkandidat in the Treaties. Not a single sentence, not a single word, nothing. I know of course that the attitude of many people in European politics, including this Chamber, towards the rules and the Treaties has been consistently cavalier, to say the least. Mr Timmermans was not a candidate of the people, of the European people. Mr Timmermans was a candidate of the left-wing political establishment and it is good that he has gone. And I hope he will not return, because essentially the Spitzenkandidat process was to conserve the power of the existing political establishment in Europe, not to open the political space for the people. Far from it. On the contrary. We have problems with rules all the time, and the European Parliament has had consistent problems with respecting the rules. Yesterday we had a lamentable spectacle which showed how a lot of people here are openly disdainful of the rules. President Tusk, of course the Council has no right whatsoever to indicate the Vice-President of the Commission – that is a blatant violation of the Treaty. It is the sole discretionary power of the President of the Commission. So, as I say, the Council is not blameless either. But there is good news, I think. The good news from the last Council is that the EU big guys failed to achieve what they wanted – they wanted to impose their own concept, their own power structure, on the rest of the Member States, with the expectation that it would be humbly accepted. Well it was not, and I hope that some lessons were drawn from that and that it will result in a change of practice. The days when two or three governments and their acolytes could dictate the solutions – even the names – to the entire European continent, are gone. What I am worried about when I hear my predecessor here is that you, ladies and gentlemen, don’t seem to draw any lessons from what happened in the elections. You seem to be determined to continue the same strategy. The number of people who are openly critical of this strategy is increasing. There are more people critical of the strategy now than there were five years ago. And the number is continuing to rise. Yet you seem to be blind and deaf – you don’t hear any warning signals, but you should, because if you do not change course then the consequences will be disastrous. As I said, there is a slight signal from the last Council that things might get better – at least I was hopeful of that – but I lost a lot of hope when I came here and listened to what most of you have said. However, when the milk is spilt please remember that I warned you.\n",

      "\tFirst of all, I would like to congratulate you again on your election, Mr Sassoli. We expect nothing less from you than to be a President who stands for transparency, for impartiality, and who also knows how to defend the rights of Parliament against the Council and also against the Commission. This brings me to the actual topic: The Council, Mr President Tusk, has now found a solution in the personnel poker, and some colleagues have complained about the result, although their political families were intensively involved in it. I want to tell you clearly at this point that the real scandal is that such solutions are found in backrooms, that solutions are worked on intransparently, without involving Parliament, and that actually make a mockery of democracy in Europe. The trust of the voters is thereby disappointed, and great damage is done to European democracy. The people outside the backrooms and also outside the upscale restaurants where these talks are said to have taken place get the impression that it's only about positions and no longer about substance. But we, as the Left in the European Parliament, have received a mandate from millions of voters to fight for a progressive political change here in Europe, in the European Union. And we gladly accept this mandate. Now, some groups, some colleagues, have been negotiating intensively with each other in recent weeks and have tried to put together a common coalition agreement. This has also been mentioned – meaning the Greens, the Social Democrats, also the Liberals and also the Conservatives. I think that minimal consensuses do not do justice to the political challenges of our time. The Left Group wants to take effective measures against the climate emergency. For that, progressive majorities are needed in this House. We want to strengthen social rights in the EU, we want to tackle tax dumping, tax evasion, and money laundering. For that, too, progressive majorities are needed in this House. And, Commissioner, the Commission recently celebrated the planned EU-Mercosur free trade agreement with great fanfare. I want to tell you that for my group, it is completely unacceptable that this agreement be signed. It cannot be the policy of the European Union to throw human rights, social rights, environmental standards overboard for a few euros! And furthermore, this agreement is also to be signed with the far-right government in Brazil. It is precisely such a policy that makes the far-right acceptable in the first place! This meets with our firm opposition. No one understands this anymore! I call on my colleagues here in Parliament to take a stand with us against this planned free trade agreement. Yes, the Left Group advocates for a humane migration and asylum policy in the EU that guarantees universal human rights.

Specifically, the European Union commits to defending the rights and freedoms of its citizens, as recognised in the Treaties, and to protecting them from existing and emerging threats. Respect for the rule of law, therefore, dear colleagues, is our utmost interest and the cornerstone of our civilisation, which keeps us united against threats, whether internal or external. The European Council, therefore, and the European Commission today, with its representative – well done! – recognise the need to confront both the illegalities and the threats from Erdoğan in the Eastern Mediterranean against the Republic of Cyprus with targeted sanctions and without delays. It is there that the rule of law of the European Union is tested, and today, all of us who believe in the European Union declare ourselves Cypriots.\n",

We are already experiencing the effects of climate change. We know the fear people face in the face of digital transformation. We know what is happening in Hungary, Poland, Romania.

I also congratulate Mr Tusk, at least from two points of view: the longevity of his mandate and the fact that he had Eastern representation. But, President Tusk, what legacy are you leaving from the Council? A lack of transparency, a total imbalance in the European institutions, between East and West, and I'm not referring only to the leaders of the three institutions, I'm also referring to the officials working in the European institutions. Please check the balance between employees in the European institutions, between Eastern and Western states. And what else are you leaving, Mr President? An incoherent strategy regarding the enlargement of the European Union, a procedure inconsistent with democracy, namely, the majority in the Council, and you are leaving two states punished - Bulgaria and Romania - even though we have the Parliament's resolution, Mr President, and you promised countless times that you would end your mandate with Romania and Bulgaria in Schengen, because we have met all the technical conditions since 2011. And what else are you leaving, Mr President? You leave the impression that everything is arranged behind a curtain, and this does not encourage European citizens to increase their trust in the European Union. Therefore, dear new colleagues, please understand that it depends on us to increase the importance and power of the European Parliament. And President Sassoli, I congratulate you on your election, but do not forget that we have extremely difficult tasks ahead of us in the coming period, and I ask you to take into account the Parliament's position in negotiations with the other two institutions.\n",

However, in this last election, it is the first time that voter turnout has risen above 50% after having declined election after election. Why? Because of the motivating force that when citizens vote, they decisively influence the leadership of the European Commission, its presidency, and you have been unable to exercise your authority to preserve the candidates who faced the electorate, not even candidate Frans Timmermans, who was vetoed by states that were called to account, precisely because of Timmermans' defense of the rule of law and democracy. But this Parliament has the final say not only in the investiture of the candidate for President of the Commission but also in that of each and every one of the twenty-eight candidates to be members of the Commission. And it would do well to rigorously examine and reject those who do not commit to the social, climate, and digital challenges, but also to the approach to migration, which must be changed to prevent the criminalization of those who save lives at sea — as has been done with the captain of the Sea Watch — or to ensure that the European Union lives up to its humanitarian action to prevent returns to unsafe countries like Libya — where a refugee camp has been bombed with a criminal toll of forty fatalities.\n",

Furthermore, it is a pleasure that agreements inconsistent with the EU treaties are being invalidated. For it is not possible to go beyond the treaties, to upset the balance between the institutions.

With the Strategic Agenda, we have a new programme, adopted unanimously by the Heads of State and Government. We will have new leaders, there is a chance for a new beginning.

      "\tMr President, I regret that Donald Tusk is not with us today, because I have had a new experience when discussing the informal Council experience. I am quite fine with the outcome of the meeting on Friday. That is why I regret that he is not present with us, because, first of all, in the preparations for 2019, the EPP Group is very thankful that we can agree on the composition and that we have legal certainty for 2019, which is important. Secondly, as regards the Spitzenkandidat, the role is clear. The Council is insisting on its role, which is legally defined in the Lisbon Treaty, and that is fine. However, I also see that the same personalities who stressed, in the informal meeting on Friday, the role of the Council are part of the party meetings, and there they are supporting the process to nominate candidates in the party format. My party will do this in Helsinki in November. That is agreed upon and that is what we will do. Frans Timmermans explained once again what parliamentary democracy means. It is not the biggest group which will have the chance, but only the candidate who can organise a majority will have the chance to be elected as Commission President. However, one thing is again crystal clear: nobody will be elected from this Parliament and from the next Parliament who was not, before the elections, put forward as a candidate from a democratic party. That is a principle. It is fixed and it has now been approved. The innovation that is ahead of us is that we need not only candidates, but we also really need attractive programmes from the different political parties to show people an alternative and to make a really European campaign. On MFF, things are on the right path. It was a constructive discussion. First of all, we have to make the EU more effective and spend money in a more effective way. Then there are the new tasks on the table, and we will need fresh new money. I sometimes hear the argument that the EU will be smaller. Dear friends, when I look at the tasks on the table – the demands for the African Fund, for the Defence Fund and for strengthening Frontex – I do not see how Europe will be smaller in the next MFF. There are lot of tasks on the table which have to be financed. The last point I want to make in my intervention today is about the most important discussion this week on Brexit, because tomorrow Theresa May will make a speech on this subject. When I look to the outcome and the developments in the last weeks in the British debate, the key question is still what the new relationship between the European Union and Great Britain will look like. One principle is clear for us: a country outside the EU cannot have the same standards and the same rights as a country inside the European Union. It is also clear for us that an endless transition period is not acceptable to us. That is why we welcome today’s presentation of a possible Leave Treaty. One point is still open, and that is the question of what these long-term relationships will look like. We need clarity on this. We hope that, when we listen tomorrow to Theresa May, we will have more clarity, for example on the future relationship with the City of London and how the Open Skies will look in the future. There are many questions on the table and we need a clear idea. I have to pick up one message we received from the UK Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson. When I look at what he said, especially on the question of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, I must say that a politician should try to solve problems and not create problems. Don’t play with the achievements of the past; don’t play with the peace process; don’t play with the future of the young generation in Northern Ireland. The EPP will be on the side of the Irish people: we will not accept a hard border, and will not risk the peace process. That is what we want to achieve. Europe is ready. We hope that London is also already.\n",

I haven’t met the European Council on the floors of this chamber. I have not seen them here. Thanks to our Bulgarian colleagues, there is not even an empty chair and there is not even an elephant in the room. There’s just nothing. I do not regret that, my dear colleague Manfred Weber – I find it a scandal – because this is about the future of Europe, and where is the President of the European Council? He will learn to take this House seriously, and he and his colleagues will learn to take this Chamber of European parliamentarians seriously because it’s about our common future, and we will not give in on these kinds of procedures. The future of Europe is about money – of course. That's why it's completely incomprehensible why so little comes out of it. These informal summits were introduced to make things easier, so that you can speak more confidently. But what is the result? What should the formal summits look like when the informal ones already reveal so little? Of course we agree to take on new tasks. Of course we know that Europe has to take care of a decent refugee policy and that we have to ensure that migration issues are dealt with sensibly. And that we care about security, old security issues - new security issues. That is our clear position. But how is this supposed to work without additional funding? Where is the commitment from the ladies and gentlemen in the European Council to allow us more of this? And in particular: where is the question of own resources? Thank you, Mr. President, for mentioning this again, that is how we discussed it. But why - it is in the hands of the people in the European Council - not finally a financial transaction tax that contributes to Europe's budget? Why not finally impose a tax on the multinationals that do business online without paying decent taxes? It's high time for that, and that's exactly what has to happen, that's exactly what has to be implemented. We are waiting for it. The European Council says that it does not agree or cannot guarantee that the leading candidates will be proposed at the end of the day or that the election will take place from among the leading candidates. We have to say to Mister Tusk and the colleagues: We could not care less. Why? We couldn't care less, because the question of whether the European parties nominate top candidates is not the property of the European Council, but of European civil society, and the parties and the citizens will make a decision on this, and not the rulers and the ladies in the European Council, it won't be like that! That is why I make it very clear: This House has committed itself not to elect anyone who has not faced this democratic competition for programs and people. We in the Socialist Group will certainly not do that because we were the pioneers of this process. We will not elect anyone who withdraws from democratic competition. We will no longer condone backroom events. We want democracy for European citizens.\n",

      "\tMr President, with friends like that, who needs enemies? Can I come back another time? (Referring toremarks made by members of the EFDDGroup.) So what came out of last Friday’s Council meeting? A clear signal that there is still a long way to go to persuade Member States to sign up to a bigger budget and also how to select the next Commission President. A number of EU Member State governments know that their voters do not want them to simply sign blank cheques to fund the ambitions of the Commission and the leaders of two or three of the larger Member States. Members of this House can no longer dismiss those voters, those politicians and those governments who question the agenda of political integration or simply label them as being anti-EU, for once you step outside the EU bubble, it is clear that the call for more Europe, whatever the problem, is the voice of an elite, not the voice of citizens in many of our countries. National governments and voters want to feel that they get value out of the EU for what they pay in. Not all of them want to see a 1950s agenda of political integration. On the whole, the voters want to see a budget that is well managed and matches their priorities, a budget that provides security and well—functioning asylum and immigration systems, and a budget that encourages a cleaner environment, innovation and job creation. But – and members of the ECR Group would want me to be very clear on this point – a budget should not be used to buy solidarity, to bribe Member States into taking asylum seekers, or to control or punish the actions of individual Member States, especially when the Member State pushing for the policy itself broke the rules and, in the process, nearly destroyed the EU’s asylum system. So, as President Tusk has already admitted, agreeing a budget before the next election is probably unrealistic, but even if all of you here and the EU institutions cannot agree on a budget, those politicians facing their electorates in 2019 should all be clear about what modernising the budget really means, about how the EU will face the massive hole after the UK leaves, and whether the EU budget will be one of coercion rather than cooperation between 27 equal Member States. So the ECR Group’s question to the Council and the Commission is simple: Is the EU facing a future where decisions continue to be made by all 27 Member States, or a future where decisions are dictated by the few?\n",

Secondly, I think we have to pay you, Mr President, a double salary in February because you have taken over the role of Mr Tusk today and that is significant because you, Mr Timmermans, spoke of the idea of ‘one hat’ in the European Union, and we have proved that it is possible for the Commission to double-hat for the Council. The only other thing, maybe, is that you can go over to the other side once, and then come back. But I will not go over the whole discussion that you had in that informal Council about Spitzenkandidaten and transnational lists. I have already said what I think about that, namely that you are making an enormous strategic mistake. You are endangering the Spitzenkandidat concept by not embedding it in a democratic process in a transnational list. The reality is that the Spitzenkandidat continues to be a toy of political parties and again between the Council on the one hand and Parliament on the other, but there is no legitimacy on the democratic front. Transnational lists provide precisely that – putting the Spitzenkandidat concept into a democratic process so it is our people who decide who is elected, and then the European Council could no longer object to the outcome of such an election. But okay: Rome was not built, as you know Mr President, in a day, and the same is true of transnational democracy. We will come back to this in 2024. On the issue of the budget, I have been involved three times in the adoption of the Multiannual Financial Framework , twice as a member of the Council and once as a Member of the European Parliament, and my fear is very simple, Mr Timmermans: that it will be business as usual. It will be a budget for seven years in which the next Parliament will have no say – no say in five years! Secondly, I fear it will be again a list of 50-60 rebates, exceptions, earmarkings, and exceptional monies to buy the support of all the Member States, and 80% of it will be money paid by the Member States going back to the Member States, and not going to the new priorities that we have – border management, innovation, migration, defence and things like that. So my appeal to all the political groups represented here is: let’s break the cycle of this European budget. Let’s make an agreement, together with the Commission, on the priorities. Secondly, on conditionality: will we continue to hear, for example, that Mr Orban is misusing European money to build a football stadium in his town, or to make his friends and family multimillionaires on the basis of European money? No! Let us establish conditionality: if you don’t accept the values, you don’t need our money. That must be the principle. And thirdly, on the issue of our responsibility. This is the only Parliament, colleagues, which has no say about income: the only one worldwide which has nothing to say about revenue. That has to change, and that means Article 311 of the Treaty, once there is a change to the Treaty, will need to incorporate co-decision by the European Parliament on income. My plea to you – and it is more important for me than the period of five years or of seven years – is that, for once, we have can cohesion in this Parliament, unity in this Parliament, on our refusal ever to accept an MFF without co-decision by Parliament on the issue of revenue. That said, if we do not decide before the next election, it will not be the fault of this Parliament. I’m pretty sure that the European Council will not be capable of reaching agreement on the next MFF before the elections.\n",

      "\tMr. President, the results of the informal Council unfortunately confirm that the Union continues the same neoliberal policies, circumventing declared principles as well as the interests of the people. In relation to the multi-annual budgetary framework, instead of discussing solidarity measures to deal with the refugee crisis, it was proposed to increase spending on the creation of Fortress Europe, by strengthening borders and patrols. Union leaders also agreed to increase investment in the military industry instead of proposing measures to support the real economy, to promote funds and investments for social and regional cohesion, to fight poverty, for employment and the creation of new quality jobs work. The policies they are promoting will not benefit the people but will lead to new conflicts, to new waves of refugees. The current humanitarian crisis in Syria is, I think, typical. Regarding the relations of the European Union with Turkey, the declaration-appeal after the informal Council of President Tusk to end the violations in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean is positive but not enough. Turkey prevented a drilling rig of the European Italian company ENI from proceeding with exploratory drilling in the Cyprus Exclusive Economic Zone and to this day continues to violate international law and the Law of the Sea with illegal Navtex. It continues the flagrant violations of the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus. We therefore expect practical solidarity from the European Union and more drastic measures, i.e. we expect pressure to be exerted on Turkey to immediately stop the illegal actions, to respect the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus and to support the resumption of the talks from where they left off during the last talks in Crans-Montana, so that we can finally lead to the solution of the Cyprus issue. I would like to remind you that on the issue of the future management of natural gas there have already been convergences between the two leaders of the two communities since 2010, to which UN Secretary General António Guterres also refers in his latest report. These convergences resolve the issue as a whole in the interest of the entire Cypriot people, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, since with the solution of the Cypriot conflict and the reunification of Cyprus, both will reap the benefits of natural gas.\n",

      "\tMr President, how we set up our long—term budget obviously reflects how we want to deal with the European Union overall, and there I do see some cause for concern. Some Member States say they just want to have enough money for their national pet projects, they want money for their farmers, they want internal security and external security, a lot of things, but they also want to pay less money, and that simply cannot work because a strong and active European Union needs resources. That does not mean that we can just spend it how we want. We have to be careful with where we invest taxpayers’ money, and I can think of quite a few cases where we can save on some of them, from big pie—in—the—sky projects like ITER to the way we choose to travel ourselves, dear colleagues. There are also plenty of examples of how EU money is being misspent in the Member States, and there we need more control and more guidance before the damage is done. EU money always needs to be spent well and in the interests of the people living in Europe, and it must never, ever contribute to corruption. The fight between Member States about who should pay what shows that we need to put the EU’s budget on a more independent footing. Own resources should be introduced now and we think they should be done in a way that enables us to actually tax and take the money from what is destroying our very own habitat. The budget will always reflect what we value most. It is a tool to finance the vision that we have for this place where we all live, for the future, and we must put the money where we think the EU should be going. We should not forget either that we have actually agreed some important international commitments. I am thinking of the Paris Agreement and climate protection, sustainable development goals, to name just a few. But money alone does not bring happiness. What we also need in the Union is a strengthened European debate and to bring decision-making closer to EU citizens, and that is where the whole discussion about the leading candidates comes in. Sure, that concept does not solve all the problems that we have, but it was – and it is – a vital step forward for a more accountable Commission and, more generally, a more accountable European Union. If Member States were to give up that progress because they were afraid that they themselves might not win or because they prefer to have some backroom deals, then this really is a slap in the face of European democracy, and whoever goes down that path should not be surprised if Europe herself gets up at some point and slaps back.\n",

You intend to impede and delay that process and overturn it if at all possible. Now I do not blame you, because you do not want us to leave and you have no incentive whatsoever to help us do it, but I do blame the British Prime Minister. What Britain needs now is a leader with the courage and spirit of a Boadicea, and instead we have got ‘Theresa the Appeaser’. In the referendum, the British people voted to leave the European Union, and what that means is that we don’t give any more money to the European Union. It means we are not bound by European Union law. It means we don’t have open borders and it means that we are not subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. To make that happen, the Government should take control of the process.

And so Mr Verhofstadt, the ALDE Group calls, for direct EU taxes. That solves the problem. You don't see it in the national budget, but the citizen does pay for it. The other Europhile parties here agree with this. The citizen is screwed again. The citizen pays for this failing project. I tell you: the EU should not spend more, but less.

These are principles that we should not argue about, and this should not be understood as pressuring people. But I would like to say one thing about the European Council and ultimately just take up one topic. A year before the European elections, that is the question of how we can bring our political project even more clearly to voters. There was a crucial point in the Treaty of Lisbon, which we rehearsed last time when we were electing the President of the Commission, but which the political parties have not yet brought into the political debate in full and in the same way everywhere: that is the question of the top candidate. We want the future to proceed as the Treaty provides - and we will not allow the European Council to pursue its own interests in the back rooms. We would like to state that in the future the head of the European administration will be elected by voters through the European Parliament, as the Treaty provides, and that this will not be a caprice between heads of government. If we do not bring this Europe closer to the citizens in the decisive positions, then this Europe will have no chance in the long term. Following this statement from the European Council, we should make it clear that the European Parliament will fight for this right over the next fifteen months.\n",

Of course we need to cope with new challenges – for example, managing migration means Europe delivering on better cooperation in development and peace-building with its entire neighbourhood – that’s for sure. But Europe also need to be ambitious on programmes which have proved to be a success, such as Erasmus, the programme for science and technology or the youth initiative. Most of all, we need to ensure strong means to provide social and territorial cohesion in Europe, because without that there is no unity among European citizens. This also means – because convergence is a central problem for us – that, when it comes to the eurozone, we need to include a fiscal capacity in the upcoming Multiannual Financial Framework. So how can we deliver on all this? Well, the answer is easy. We have to accept, once and for all, that we need new own resources to finance our common budget. And there is a further matter on which the leaders were too shy, namely the right way to understand European democracy, because some of them are hesitant about the need for European parties to put up their own candidates in European elections, presenting their own programmes in such a way that citizens can choose not only legislators but also executive power.

Are you aware of the fact that, economically, Brexit is equivalent to 19 countries leaving the European Union at the same time? There are very complex logistical supply chains in danger – customer relationships, supplier relationships – and, in the end, Britain will become the largest British customer. I wonder why we are continuing to try to punish Britain for their decision. Instead the Commission should focus on placing the interests of the European Union as priority number one. Those interests are very similar to Britain’s interests. Any deal which is good for British industry is also a very good deal for European industry, and that is why I believe we should change the Commission’s priorities.

Likewise, the European Parliament must emphasize the opportunity that the European Council risks losing by passing up an unavoidable meeting with a European Union better than the current one. The proposal approved by this Parliament to link the presidency of the Commission to the head of the list of each of the great political families is a commitment to civic, citizen and European culture. There are many of us who also voted in favor of transnational lists, because they represent the beginning of a pan-European response to a need for pan-European citizenship and representation in this European Parliament. The European Council can under no circumstances miss the opportunity to relaunch the European Union and lift it out of this state of decline, if not paralysis, in which it has unfortunately been in recent years.\n",

      "\tAt the last meeting of the European Council, on 23 February, the brutal and endless catastrophe in Syria was once again addressed, in which we continue to witness the loss of human lives, the spread of terror, misery and disgrace. The Council called for the immediate implementation of a ceasefire. Fortunately, this ceasefire was declared, although, in the meantime, there have been violations of it. This is a first step, but we cannot forget that this first step has already been taken in the past, without creating the conditions for the establishment of lasting peace. The European Union and its Member States must act in an uncompromising manner and without excluding from the outset the use of stronger forms of intervention, if necessary, to put an end once and for all to this tragedy, which it takes lives, destroys a country and shames humanity.\n",

      "\tRegarding the Multiannual Financial Framework , Romania has confirmed that Member States need to increase their contributions to the EU budget in order to enhance the Union’s capacities to deal with new realities in an efficient manner. Facing the numerous security challenges arising from the south and east, reinforcing border management through the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and showing European solidarity with Africa represent new engagements that require new capital. Furthermore, I would like to stress that, in the new EU27 format, the budgetary gap caused by Brexit should not under any circumstances be filled by resources from our European fundamental policies such as the cohesion fund or the common agriculture policy , given the alarming effects that scenario could produce on our societies. Therefore, I salute the decisions of the Member States that have already expressed their agreement on an increased budgetary contribution, and I would remind the ones that have not done so that the European project brings to each of us incomparably more gains than our expenditure. I will end by making a comparison: while the EU’s annual budget is below 1% of Europe’s GDP, the federal budget of the United States is equivalent to 30% of its GDP.\n",

      "\tThe informal Council meeting discussed the make-up of the upcoming European Parliament, including the so-called ‘Spitzenkandidaten’ process to elect the President of the Commission. This issue needs to be given further consideration both by the European Parliament and by the Council. Both sides seem to be making assumptions about democracy and political legitimacy that have little to no resonance among European people. Another point discussed was the upcoming Multiannual Financial Framework. Given new priorities and the funding vacuum being created through Brexit, there is clearly a need to explore other ways of funding. When proposing own resources for EU funding, the economic sensitivities of each Member State must be duly respected. Similarly, new funding priorities should not downgrade cohesion as a crucial tool of European policy. They must take into consideration the different constitutions of the Member States. Defence has now emerged for some as a leading priority. The EU as of now is not a military union. Defence spending should be kept separate from the common MFF. This would allow those that want to participate in a defence union to do so, without imposing additional burdens on those Member States wishing to opt out.\n",

      "\tThe European Council discussed important topics for its future seeking to find common ground, acceptable for all. We shouldn’t be divided on issues where we should be united. Tackling effects of the migration crisis is our common endeavour. We have to allocate resources in the financial framework which would help us to tackle migratory challenges. These resources, nevertheless, shouldn’t be unduly mixed with other European issues, such as cohesion policy and structural funds in general. These have been created to underpin a strong European economy and cohesion between Member States within the single market. Creating undue linkages with other sectorial agenda would compromise their effectiveness and added value. This does not mean conditionalities shouldn’t be put in place. The Rule of Law is a basic prerequisite not only for participating in the European project but also in the common market, and they could be included in one way or another in close linkage with the spending of the budget. This does not mean either that we shouldn’t fight to have resources to address migratory pressures. On the contrary, these are needed. But resources to address such pressures should stay transparently separated to be able to withstand migratory challenges effectively and in a united way.\n",

      "\tThe topics discussed at the last meeting of the European Council in the context of the future EU multi-annual budget also included the common agricultural policy. The CAP accounts for 37% of the EU budget, but in the past this share was even twice as high. Direct payments financed from it constitute as much as 50% of farmers' income - income that amounts to only half of the income of other professional groups. Low farmers' incomes are the reason for the lack of young farmers. The financial situation of farmers without the CAP would be catastrophic. Let us remember that the CAP benefits not only farmers, but all consumers, because thanks to CAP funds, food is cheaper and the purchase of production means increases, which also improves the situation of the machinery and chemical industries and trade. The CAP ensured food security in terms of universal access to food of adequate quality and affordable prices. Farmers provide society with a number of public goods in the field of the environment and landscaping, for which they are not remunerated. This situation requires maintaining CAP financing at an unchanged level.\n",

      "\tThe definition of the next Multiannual Financial Framework is essential to consolidate the European project. European leaders had the first opportunity at the Informal Council on February 23 to convey a credible and consistent message to European citizens about the path forward. Being a first approach, it is normal that the positions have still been very different, but as we approach a new electoral cycle within the European framework, it is essential that the next steps are ambitious and mobilizing. In an increasingly competitive global context, the European Union must make convergence the keyword in all its strategies: internal convergence to take advantage of synergies and its full potential and external convergence with the highest standards of innovation and sustainability . Competitiveness, cohesion, agricultural, migration, security and defense policies must be interconnected with a strong drive for innovation and social inclusion. This is the approach that will make the most of the budgetary resources made available by Member States and their own resources, particularly those resulting from charges made in transnational value chains in the financial, environmental or digital domain.\n",
