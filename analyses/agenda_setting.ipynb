      "\tMr President, honourable Members, Europe's migration policy of recent years is untenable. We are witnessing systematic human rights violations at our borders, pushbacks that often go unpunished, and a Dublin system that works neither for the Member States nor for those seeking protection. Therefore, it is clear: in this parliamentary term, Europe finally needs effective solutions for migration and asylum, clear rules for control and solidarity based on our values of democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights, including the right to asylum in Europe. The reform of the Common European Asylum System can contribute to this, but it is also just one piece of the puzzle for a comprehensive migration policy. What is currently missing includes a stronger role for municipalities and civil society, cooperation with countries of origin on an equal footing, without outsourcing our humanitarian responsibility, and not least, simpler and expanded possibilities for legal entry into the EU, also to address our economy's growing need for workers. Only if we tackle these challenges will we succeed in shaping migration sustainably and in the interest of all involved parties in the future. So, much work lies ahead of us in the coming years.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tToday, however, we are discussing the present legislative package, which includes proposals that can only now be concluded after eight years. That we had to wait so long for a reform due to the blockade by the Member States is shameful. Also shameful are the circumstances in which negotiations with the Council took place: instead of a contractually stipulated loyal cooperation between the institutions, there was a Council that refused many compromises, often without clear arguments. Therefore, we are not voting today on a perfect legislative package – it is not even a very good one – and I will not conceal points of criticism: mandatory border procedures without exception for families, inadmissibility decisions for supposedly safe third countries, and instrumentalisation are highly problematic elements, the necessity of which the Council could not even explain. This must be particularly critically monitored during implementation. In my report, the screening, we also had to make concessions – for example, the screening of persons already present in the territory. Here, there are even considerable doubts as to whether the existing legal basis permits this measure.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tNevertheless, the package also contains positive elements: in the screening, for example, important protection measures and uniform standards, or a significantly strengthened, independent fundamental rights monitoring mechanism, which is also extended to the border procedures. Furthermore, solidarity-based cooperation among Member States will become mandatory for the first time – this is an important first step towards shared responsibility – and a resettlement framework will also be introduced. In addition to an individual assessment of the various texts, the overall picture is also important for our decision, and this shows: after years of deadlock in the Council, we have finally succeeded in reaching an agreement on asylum reform. This will enable us to ensure that European law is upheld everywhere in Europe and that Member States, having approved this by qualified majority, also implement it. We also expect the Commission to resume its role as guardian of the Treaties, a role it has neglected or even ignored for far too long, especially under Commission President von der Leyen.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tOur commitment to a solidarity-based and progressive migration policy does not end today. Rather, in addition to the missing elements mentioned at the outset, one of our core tasks in the coming legislative term will be to monitor that the new law is fully implemented – in all Member States and, yes, respecting our fundamental rights, including the right to asylum. Then this reform, too, can be a step in the right direction.\n",

      "\tMr President, Madam Commissioner, dear Ylva Johansson, dear colleagues, we are at a moment of truth. After three and a half years of complex and demanding work, and almost ten years after the Syrian refugee migration crisis, we face a crucial vote to finally reform the European asylum and migration system. This pact is a coherent, complementary set of texts to finally address the migratory challenge, as Europeans. Together, we champion four priority objectives. The first: to ensure strategic steering of European asylum policy among the 27 Member States, with a prominent role for the Commission in coordination and monitoring. The second element: an unprecedented solidarity mechanism at European level to assist Member States in the event of migratory pressure or crisis. The third pillar: to establish better control of irregular immigration at the external borders of the European Union, thanks to accelerated border procedures for applicants manifestly ineligible for asylum. Finally, to implement more harmonised, more effective asylum procedures within the European Union, accompanied by essential rights for minors, for families, and for all asylum seekers. These various legislative instruments will enable the European Union to be better prepared to respond to the main challenges of immigration. This pact will not solve everything, but it is a step forward, a giant leap towards real control and sound, humane management of immigration in France, in Europe, and on our continent. Nor is this the end of the road. We will have to put all our energy, as my colleague Birgit Sippel has just reminded us, into ensuring the implementation and respect of the new rules in all countries of the Union. With my Renew group, we will follow this implementation with extreme vigilance and we count, Madam Commissioner, on the European Commission to fully play its role as guardian of the treaties. Indeed, we have already started working on measures, particularly for families. Dear colleagues, we face our responsibilities: to vote against the pact, offering a victory to the European far right which has done everything to obstruct the development of solutions to migratory challenges (in our country, France, for example, it is the Rassemblement National that does not want solutions, cynically feeding off problems); or to vote for this pact responsibly. Dear elected colleagues from centrist and pro-European parties, I call on you to support this pact. Our fellow citizens want action, not grand speeches.\n",
      "[x] 4: Tomas Tobé (PPE - christian_conservative) [39% migration]\n",
      "\tMr President, Commissioners, today, we have an historic opportunity to finally put in place a common European migration policy. After migration crisis after migration crisis, after political failure after political failure, we can finally deliver to the European citizens. Most of us understand that if we have a common external border, we also need more common migration policy. The EPP Group will support the migration pact. We think that it is crucial that we start to take back control from the smugglers, because we need to decide who will actually enter the European Union. We need to strengthen our common border, because only so can we also ensure that we move towards a policy when we can give protection to those in need and not to irregular migrants. We also, in the migration pact, finally acknowledge that we need to cooperate also with third countries if we want to manage migration in a better way in the future. Finally, and perhaps even more important: in the migration pact, we make it clear that we need to cooperate better within the Union. It cannot be so that this comes to responsibility for a few Member States, where we try to find different ad hoc solutions. Now we make it clear that it is a responsibility for everyone to contribute. This is basically about building trust: building trust between the Member States, but also building trust from the citizens that the European politicians actually can deliver also when it comes to migration. Yes, the negotiations have been long – and let’s be honest, they have been hard, even within this House and together with the Council. But from the EPP Group, I would like to thank for the cooperation with the S&D Group and the Renew Group, and also with some responsible delegations in the ECR Group. But I still hear many colleagues in this House now that are ready to do whatever it takes to stop the migration pact. And I would like to turn to The Left Group and the Greens Group. You very often give speeches about the far right, but the truth is today you want to stop the migration pact together with Le Pen and AfD. That is the truth. You should instead vote in favour of the migration pact because then we could put a stop to the horrific numbers of deaths on the Mediterranean Sea. Don’t leave this in the hands of the smugglers. Colleagues, today we have an opportunity to send a clear message: Europe can agree also on divisive issues. Let’s move away from the political deadlock. Let’s move forward to a migration policy that actually works for everyone and that will, for certain, work better than what we have today. Vote in favour of the migration pact. Vote in favour for Europe.\n",
      "[x] 5: Juan Fernando López Aguilar (PSE/S&D - social_democratic) [45% migration]\n",
      "\tMr. President, Mr. Vice-President, Madam Commissioner, Members of the European Parliament, today we are undertaking a decisive, indeed a defining, vote, not only looking at the past and present of the European Parliament, but, above all, looking towards the future. Because it is, to begin with, about fulfilling a mandate of European Law, of the Treaty of Lisbon and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union: that there be a common migration system, with a common European migration policy and legislation, and a common asylum system, with an asylum policy and legislation that provide added value to the unilateral, fragmented, and insufficient solutions of the Member States, which we have described as unsustainable, as well as unjust. It is about, therefore, finally bringing European law into force, and doing so, moreover, with respect for our values and by providing a joint approach to the five Regulations, which are five directly binding laws. One of them is the Regulation on crisis situations, which is not the ordinary response, but the response to situations in which a Member State declares itself overwhelmed by a massive or quantitatively very significant, very impactful arrival of irregular migrants, especially after search and rescue operations, also at regional and island scales. This therefore requires an articulated European solidarity mechanism, a European response cushion, a European solidarity that involves the Commission with an implementing act and also the Council through the Commission's Recommendation to elevate its offers of solidarity to all Member States, either through orderly relocation programs, finally coordinated by a European coordinator, or through contributions to the Asylum and Migration Fund, which help Member States to equip themselves to offer an adequate response to these emergency situations. It is about, therefore, finally enacting predictable European legislation with legal certainty in areas where there has only been action-reaction until now. It is also about doing so with common guarantees, in particular through the protection of people in the most vulnerable situations, such as women, women with dependent children, unaccompanied minors and, of course, victims of trafficking. These situations require differentiated treatment, and that is what we have fought hard for in the negotiation with this Council. Of course, we are aware that this issue has not been easy. In fact, it has been the most divisive and thorny issue on the European agenda for too long. Therefore, the negotiation has not been easy in this European Parliament, and certainly it has not been easy with the 27 interior ministries, which is the Council with which we have addressed the final phase. It must be said that in every negotiation concessions must be made and the result has limitations. But the result, if it offers legal certainty and guarantees, is always better than no result at all. Of course, it is better than leaving things as they are. It is better than abandoning the governments of the Member States to their fate. It is better than sending the message that, every time there is an emergency migration situation in island situations such as in the Canary Islands, Lampedusa, or the Greek islands, the response simply has to be strictly national and no solidarity can be expected from the European Union. No, that cannot be the future of the European Union, nor can it be the message for the elections on June 9th. The message must be that we have done everything in our power. Have we done everything? No. It remains, of course, to fulfil our own mandate to establish a coordinated European search and rescue mechanism, and to jointly and effectively fight against criminal organizations that traffic and exploit people, as well as to continue opening legal and safe pathways that give an opportunity to people fleeing desperation to reach Europe without risking their lives in the attempt or tragically losing them, as has been happening for too long. The two options are clear: either rules are established with guarantees, with all the limits and all the criticisms that one specific point or another may have raised, which is inevitable in such a complex negotiation, or Member States are simply abandoned to their fate. The situation could worsen even further if, after all the accumulated work and all the energy and time we have consumed on this, the message were that we have not succeeded, because much worse than the situation as it is—which is already unbearable—is to have tried and failed. Taking a step forward, with all its limitations and also with guarantees, is within our reach if we vote in favor of each of the Regulations, of the European laws that make up this pact.\n",

      "\tMr President, Commissioners, I briefly thank the shadow rapporteurs, as befits the style that should illuminate political activity: conciseness in words, clarity in ideas, and simplicity in their application; unfortunately, something that is not common in this house. Thanks, above all, to the group assistants, who are the ones who truly work hard. We have achieved it. The Eurodac reform is about to be voted on: a harmonised, revised, expanded database to improve the identification of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers who attempt to cross or cross our borders, enter or are found on European territory without legal grounds for their presence on our soil.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tA new database no longer built on asylum applications, but on individual records, to put an end to the fraud of those who go to several countries seeking international protection or residence permits based on social integration, seeking to deceive national authorities and obtain papers in some Member State. Perhaps that is why many NGOs and associations that cooperate—by action or omission—with the illicit trafficking of people are so concerned with Eurodac.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tWe have achieved it: a database in which we will record not only fingerprints, but also facial images, travel documents—or their absence—and any incident that constitutes an alert for Europe's internal security. Eurodac will come to include beneficiaries of the different forms of international protection, to prevent secondary movements within the European space of those who already have protection in one country and to prevent abuses of protection systems and social security.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tBy including facial images and travel documents, it will facilitate the work of authorities in identifying those who carry false documents or those who try to frustrate their identification by authorities at the border—as is now happening massively in Spain—since there will be a security alert. Lowering the age for data collection from fourteen to six years will allow for a more complete picture of arrivals and, above all, facilitate reunification with parents, with whom minors should be, and not in the hands of associations that profit from them in flats or reception centers.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tThe message we send is clear: our law must be obeyed, and if you do not obey it, we will identify you, we will pursue you, and we will return you to your place of origin. Eurodac does not solve the problem of illegal immigration, but it is a first step: to identify and register. Much remains to be done. How many illegal immigrants enter via the Canary Islands today with records of terrorism or serious crimes in their countries, and European authorities are unaware of it?\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tCooperation with third countries requires demanding that they upload data from their national criminal records and that these also be included in Eurodac to be used as grounds for refusal of entry. The next steps will have to be taken in the next legislature: ensuring that Morocco, Algeria, or Mauritania actively cooperate to cut off the Canary Islands routes and the Western Mediterranean routes, and in any case, accept returns ordered by our authorities at the border—of all individuals—using all legitimate means at our disposal, including, of course, the suspension of trade agreements or the payment of development aid.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tThe institution of residence permits based on social integration in European territory must be repealed as an illegitimate and fraudulent way of obtaining them; border protection must be strengthened; the pull factor must be discouraged by prohibiting extraordinary regularisations of illegal immigrants in the European space; and states that comply with the expulsion of illegals must be rewarded, not those that fail to comply.\n",

      "\tThank you, Mr. President! The Left is deeply critical of the agreement being debated and voted on today. Hundreds of NGOs and organisations working on refugee solidarity, life-saving, and support for people seeking protection here in Europe have been very clear: we MEPs should say no to this agreement. Today's vote, which we will have later this evening, does not solve the problems it is supposed to solve. There will be no automatic redistribution of those seeking protection; instead, the first country of arrival remains responsible. There will be no real solidarity. Nothing, absolutely nothing, is being done to stop the deaths in the Mediterranean. On the contrary. The increasingly closed borders will lead to more brutality, increasingly dangerous routes, and greater risks. Instead, we get more of what doesn't work, and I wish more of you had been there to see what it looks like at the EU's borders. We will see more systematic detention, imprisonment of people at the EU's borders with the dehumanisation that entails. We will see more violence and degradation, and believe me, there is already a lot of that brutality even now. We will see deterrence and confinement. We will see more cooperation with dictatorships and despots. It started with Turkey, as you surely remember. But now we are here. The so-called Libyan coast guard, which consists of militias that force people back to torture and violence. We are going to cooperate with Tunisia, Egypt. All to stop people on the run. One of the most serious problems with this agreement is that the individual right to asylum is being attacked. It is being undermined in a terrible way, as EU countries will say that you and you and you came from a so-called safe third country and you will not even have your protection grounds examined. That is to say, we will not even assess your protection grounds. That is, de facto, rendering the right to asylum null and void. And some of you, far too many here, say that nothing else could have been achieved. We've heard that before, haven't we? It's called TINA – There Is No Alternative. But why engage in politics if you are here to dystopically follow in the footsteps of the far-right and right-wing nationalism? That is certainly not the path of the Left. All of us, and I mean all of us here from all political families, know that we can do so much better. And we have shown it. When Putin's bombs fall on Ukrainian citizens, then we ensure protection for those who must flee. That is the path we should have chosen. That is still the path we should choose. Not this brutal, dehumanising way. There is one proposal that stands out in today's package, and that is the Left's proposal, which we have worked on, and for which I have been the rapporteur. It concerns a European quota refugee system. It concerns a humanitarian system. There, we provide protection, a safe path for people, the most vulnerable refugees. We cooperate with the UN, with UNHCR. We ensure that we provide support and aid, that we support those countries that receive a great many refugees, often millions. That is what we do in the Left. We roll up our sleeves when the rest of your political families want to close borders, increase brutality, and abolish the right to asylum. But then, we in the Left open legal, safe migration routes. This system for quota refugees is not obligatory for member states to participate in. But it is a way for people to reach safety and security to seek protection here in Europe. I am proud of that. I hope that every single member state takes this chance to offer protection to people seeking it here in Europe. And I promise you, that is the Europe the citizens want to see. They do not want to be part of a dystopian Europe where the only choice is to trudge along with the nationalist right. We know we can do so much better than that. So make sure to vote in the Left and humanitarian forces into this Parliament when you get the chance in June.\n",

      "\tEurope is at a crossroads. Migration and asylum policy are among the most divisive issues for our citizens and for politics in general, and often a means of manipulation, extortion, and excuses. We have felt the consequences everywhere, including in the Schengen area. Reform of the entire field of migration was essential. In the long run, the survival of the Union as such also depends on it. So, after eight years of blockades and several attempts, we have succeeded. Later, we will vote on the entire package of renewed migration and asylum legislation. With these, Europe enters a new era. What we have on the table is not a perfect solution; it is a compromise. However, reform is a strategic necessity that we in the European Parliament are adopting with a heavy heart. But we are not shying away from our responsibility. This is what European citizens, above all, expect from us. I myself was the rapporteur for the reform of the Qualification Regulation. The bulk of the text was already agreed in 2018, but Europe and the world were different then. I am convinced that such a text would no longer be possible to adopt today, given the current circumstances in the EU. So, the proposed Qualification Regulation was part of the first unsuccessful asylum policy reform in 2016. The regulation will replace the existing Qualification Directive and sets out in one place the standards regarding the conditions for obtaining international protection in the Union – either refugee status or subsidiary protection status – and, on the other hand, the rights of beneficiaries in the event of a positive decision. This regulation is, therefore, a key component of the future European asylum system and will ensure equal treatment of applications across Europe. This will help deter 'asylum shopping' and thereby indirectly reduce the phenomenon of secondary migration. Until now, the application of the directive has been very arbitrary among countries. They had to implement the directive into national law and also enforce it. However, there were significant variations and deviations in this process. We know of cases where, for example, an applicant for international protection from Afghanistan had virtually no chance of a positive decision in one Member State, while having an almost one hundred percent chance in another Member State. Let us hope, therefore, that such stories will be a thing of the past and that Europe will truly come alive in this area too. Allow me now to focus on the main substantive highlights. Among the main achievements of the Qualification Regulation, I certainly count the uniform minimum length of residence permits. This will be valid for at least 3 years for refugee status, and for subsidiary protection status, a minimum of one year, followed by a minimum of two years upon renewal. Status review will not be automatic and mandatory. Indeed, the beneficiary's status is maintained as long as there is a need for their protection. I am particularly proud of this success. We also succeeded in broadening the definition of family for the purposes of the regulation. A novelty of the regulation is the assessment of the availability of internal protection. Thanks to this House, we have significantly limited the application of this principle. This will only be mandatory in cases where the persecution of the applicant is not carried out by the state. Refugees will also receive greater protection due to the faster issuance of residence permits. These must also be free of charge. Henceforth, the period of residence that counts towards obtaining a permanent residence permit will be calculated from the date of application, and not, as before, only half the time from application to recognition of protection. The processing of applications can, in some cases, take more than a year, which is why this change is more than important, it is extremely important. Furthermore, beneficiaries will be treated equally with citizens of the host country regarding rights such as social and healthcare, rights concerning access to work, and, of course, education. Moreover, unaccompanied minors, who are a particularly vulnerable category, will now be entitled to greater protection and safeguards. In this case too, I am proud of the European Parliament's success. Esteemed colleagues, hoping for a favourable outcome, I thank you for your cooperation and attention.\n",

      "\tMr President, Commissioner, colleagues, big majority of Europeans want a humane and controlled European migration policy, and that is why we have to end years of chaos and inhumane circumstances, because we will not be able to explain to our voters that we end this term in chaos. We’ve witnessed in recent years the total collapse of trust between the Member States. We’ve seen pushbacks and violence at the external borders, inhumane reception conditions and asylum seekers sleeping on the streets of the richest countries on this planet. Over the past eight years, we’ve worked tirelessly for a package that is in line with our values, while the political climate is getting chillier by the day. Compromises have been reached just before Christmas with great difficulty, and I find it tragic that this House found itself defending European values against the Council because, regretfully, many governments are not upholding those same values, and they will aim to deny as many asylum claims as possible and put as many people in indefinite detention as they can, including children. That is why the European Commission needs to be tough and enforce the law that we’re going to vote today. The European Commission will have to do a lot more to convince us that it will actually enforce the new pact, because in recent years it allowed human rights violations to happen and it didn’t lift a finger, I’m sorry to say. Dirty deals with Tunisia, colleagues, cannot be considered a confidence-building measure either, for that matter. But this House also has a responsibility. We will have to hold the European Commission to account, and we have not done so for the last five years. If we’re criticising the Commission – and I am criticising the Commission – we also have to acknowledge that we let the Commission get away with it for the past five years and we didn’t lift a finger. Today in the vote, the far right will be showing its true colours. It will vote against because it doesn’t really want solutions. It wants chaos and misery to continue because that’s what they feed on. There are also colleagues who will vote against for understandable and legitimate reasons, and I share many of their concerns. But I still think that we should endorse the package because we have a responsibility as politicians – because if we reject the pact, there will be nothing in its place. There’s not going to be a better alternative, but we’ll end up with a situation where no single rule will be respected anymore and we’ll end in a race to the bottom and the end to the right of asylum in Europe. We cannot, unfortunately, legislate away an ultra-right majority because even if you reject the package, that majority will still be there and it may actually be bigger in the next term. And are you going to entrust the next Parliament with the elaboration of our asylum policies? Well, not me, colleagues, not me. With regard to my own file – the Reception Conditions Directive – we’ve obtained many guarantees and safeguards for asylum seekers, especially for the most vulnerable. We have ensured a legal representative for all unaccompanied children from the day they arrive. We made sure that the detention of children is the absolute exception and only with judicial authorisation. We’ve guaranteed asylum seekers access to education and language courses and quicker access to the labour market. We ensured specific attention for vulnerable groups like women, children and LGBTIQ people, and the standards laid down in the Reception Conditions Directive will apply to the entire package, and upholding all of these elements in the implementation of the pact is crucial, because it can only work if it has the trust of everyone. The weakness lies not in the legal text, colleagues, that is quite clear. It lies in the implementation by the Member States and enforcement by the European Commission. So today we need to prove the cynics wrong and show that asylum is a European matter requiring a European response in line with our European values – and we take responsibility.\n",

      "\tMr./Madam President, today we are voting on a fundamental revision of European asylum policy. Nine years after the 2015 crisis, a plan is finally on the table that puts an end to the chaos and suffering at our external borders. This plan entails strict screening and reception at those external borders, distinguishing between genuine refugees and migrants from safe countries, with mandatory border procedures and return for the latter group, and more solidarity within Europe. In other words: with this Migration Pact, we are finally gaining control over migration. Finally, it will no longer be human traffickers but the Member States that determine who gains access to the EU. Of course, a compromise like this is rarely perfect. Not all challenges will be solved as if by magic. But it is a very important first step on which we must build further. Let us not delude ourselves. A vote against this Pact is not a vote for better policy. No, a vote against is a vote for maintaining the current situation, for years more of high influxes of illegal migration, for overcrowded reception centres and a lack of control at the external borders, for the business model of human traffickers and their life-threatening routes. A vote against today is a vote for the status quo. That is where the far-left – and I include the Greens in that – and the far-right are trying to find common ground today. Horseshoe theory in its purest form. A dark coalition between Frans Timmermans and Geert Wilders, while people across Europe have been concerned about migration for years and rightly expect the European Union to act. That is a colossal responsibility for all of us here in this chamber today. Let us not shirk that responsibility.\n",

And it is perhaps truly one of the most important decisions we will take in this legislative term – and it is certainly also one of the hardest for many. But in fact, European citizens are currently looking at us and seeing whether, after years of blockages and negotiations, we manage to truly get to grips with this. And does the Pact solve all problems? No. Is it better than the status quo? Yes, and many have already pointed that out. And I know that this Pact also contains points that are painful, and I too feel that, for example, when I see that families with small children are not particularly protected in border procedures. But nothing else was possible with the Member States. And if Europe is not able to act in this area, which is a core area because it can only be resolved at a European level, then that only fuels the right-wingers, those who seek to divide, those who want chaos and who are banking on Europe being incapable of action.

This is a historic moment because for a long time we have been trying to work towards European solutions when it comes to migration. I understand the various individual interests. I understand the emotions, but these always block the solutions. So it is about responsibility. In my opinion, all those who negotiated have shown their responsibility. But everything also depends on the people who may not have been so closely involved in the negotiations on the legislation. It is your responsibility to vote. If you vote against, you vote for maintaining the current situation: a major humanitarian drama, no control over migration. So only by working together and making your voice heard for this Pact, do we take a step forward. It is not ideal. It can always be better in various respects, but we are taking a step forward.

This pact offers no solution to better manage arrivals, to end deaths in the Mediterranean, human trafficking, reception crises in our Member States, violations of fundamental rights, or the right to asylum. The pact, on the contrary, seals this Fortress Europe in its texts and its collaboration with dictatorships.

On the one hand, too many deaths at sea, the huge business of human trafficking, the pro-immigration political battle of NGO ships, lauded and rewarded in this Chamber, despite representing the link with human smugglers. On the other hand, the loss of security in our cities, the increase in undeclared work with the consequent compression of workers' rights, the hateful exploitation of women, the spread of Islamic radicalism with its most violent manifestations. Improving the current situation: this is the only reason to vote in favour of some of the regulations in the new Pact. A few steps in the right direction, few but important, with the hope of continuing on this path with greater resolve during the next European legislature. Departures must be stopped by collaborating with the migrants' countries of origin and transit, establishing first who has the right to enter Europe and who does not. This is the only possible structural solution, also by helping developing nations to remove the causes of emigration. This is what we have been trying for years to make the left understand, that they would like to let everyone in, indiscriminately, and then give them the right to vote and thus supplant the will of our populations. The 71% decrease in landings in Italy and the drastic reduction in deaths at sea confirm the effectiveness of the Meloni government's choice to prevent arrivals, working patiently and with determination on the external dimension of European borders. Unfortunately, a lot of time has been lost, and today it is difficult to delve into the merits of the new regulations, just a few weeks before the vote.

Faced with this existential challenge, the European Union chooses the path of weakness and that of the pull factor. Reception or financial contribution from states – this is how President Macron's representatives here summarize this pact, with their characteristic out-of-touch tone. It is, in reality, submersion or punishment. Our countries will be forced to host thousands of migrants in their towns and villages, or else pay, and pay dearly, to be spared. Brussels wants to distribute. We, we want to send them back. We will therefore oppose this pact of submersion, with its incessant pull factors, with the brutality by which you inflict upon the peoples migratory waves that they no longer desire.

We have wrestled in this House, we have argued, we have debated, we have listened and explored, we have repeatedly pulled things back together. We were so often deadlocked, we left negotiating rooms, and precisely when things got difficult, we kept searching for the delicate balance that the Pact ultimately entails. That is the strength of this House, which is capable of so much more than it sometimes shows. Today we stand here and decide whether all these efforts, all these debates, have been worthwhile, whether they were right or in vain.

It is about no longer ceding control to criminal networks and traffickers over who comes to us and who does not. It is about correcting the mistakes of 2019.

We are indeed willing to take responsibility for an asylum policy. But it must be an asylum policy that works and that does not capitulate to right-wing sentiment, but rather considers pragmatic solutions based on the rule of law, human rights, and solidarity.

There is no protection for the desperate people crossing the desert, as they will remain at the mercy of criminals. There is no protection in our territories, lands now conquered and subject to the danger of terrorism. There is no protection for European society and culture from those who think, with your complicity, that they can subjugate it.

The timing could not be more opportune, as last year's figures bring us closer to a crisis similar to that of 2015. That is why the EPP Group supports this pact to strengthen the protection of our external borders and prevent threats to the security of our citizens. It is a balance between responsibility and solidarity that eases the pressure particularly on frontline countries, such as Spain, while at the same time providing guarantees to those who genuinely need international protection. United against the pact, as expected, are the extremes: the naive do-goodism on one side and alarmist fatalism on the other. Despite this, for the EPP Group, a stable and lasting solution is presented today for the benefit of all Europeans.\n",

      "\tMadam President, we are at the end of a long debate on the Asylum and Migration Pact, which concludes on the eve of the European elections, necessarily bringing a very significant political dimension to the vote awaiting us. To determine our vote, let us ask ourselves three questions. Does the Pact address the indignity in the treatment of migrants? Does it address the disorder at the borders? Does it lead Member States to demonstrate collective responsibility and solidarity? In all three cases, the answer is no. And I add: alas! Indeed, it is clear that while we do not know what the Pact will truly achieve, we do know that it will not solve the problems denounced by the Member States. Worse still, it marks unprecedented setbacks for fundamental rights while generalising derogating procedures. Thus, there is the impression of doing something, but without a solution for frontline countries, for example, and without a binding principle of solidarity. Let everyone be aware, furthermore, that the Pact does not address major issues. It is silent on relations with countries of origin for migration and asylum. It will have no effect on the movement of people. It makes no mention of the enormous resources that nevertheless need to be deployed concerning the Pact. It says nothing about the deadly business of smugglers, nor about the necessity of a European 'Search and Rescue' operation, nor about legal pathways. It speaks even less about integration and avoids reflection on climate migration and asylum. It is impossible to support it.\n",

Don't let yourselves be fooled by the far-left or the far-right, who have apparently found each other in a devil's pact to scuttle this necessary pact. We have been discussing this for eight years. Finally, with the upcoming vote, we will hopefully take the first necessary steps towards a European Asylum and Migration Pact. No, colleagues, not everything is perfect. If you look, you will always find points of criticism. But do you know what is good about this pact? Finally, there will be a European approach. Finally, there will be stricter controls at the external borders. Finally, there will be more solidarity between Member States. Is it perfect? No, according to us, the liberals of Renew Europe, much more needs to be done. Yes, official labour migration must also be made possible. Yes, I want an even much tougher approach to human traffickers. And yes, I would also very much like to protect those missing children in migration.

This pact was our chance to share responsibility, end pushbacks, uphold the right to asylum and make reception human again. I acknowledge the improvements. I am glad that we stimulate resettlement and that for the first time Member States must offer solidarity. But I urge them to fulfil this obligation in the only meaningful way, by offering relocation. But I am extremely worried that these rules systematically lock up asylum seekers – even families with children – at the external borders, for months on end. This law erodes the rights and safeguards of asylum seekers and risks dangerous deportations. It allows for undermining the common standards, which is exactly the opposite of what we need. We need to foster a common policy based on mutual trust. So we are far from fixing the asylum system. Let us indeed take responsibility to finally get it right.\n",

Then you limited provisions on combating human traffickers. Then you write only about the Union's obligations towards migrants, and not migrants' obligations towards our community. Next, you introduced forced relocation to countries like Poland or the payment of a migration tax, 20,000 euros per immigrant. What have you actually done? In reality, you've sent a love letter to human traffickers, encouraging them to push as many people as possible into the sea, because it's known they will be accepted anyway, without any criteria. What will be the effects of this? Firstly, you'll line the pockets of smugglers, many people will drown, you'll create problems for Europe, you'll extract money from countries like Poland, and you won't solve any problem. None whatsoever. So, it's time for a radical change in the upcoming elections. Don't vote for the centre-left, vote for traditional Europe. We will revoke these documents and the Green Deal.\n",

The EU Migration Pact is not at all about defending our borders against this asylum invasion.

The regulation on crisis and force majeure situations, for which I had the honour to be rapporteur for my political group, the EPP Group, allows Member States to address sudden and massive influxes of third-country nationals, by way of derogation from the general provisions, always of course with respect for the fundamental rights of asylum seekers. And we also managed to include the instrumentalisation of migrants —a long-standing tactic of third countries, such as Turkey. This is a significant political achievement, especially for frontline Member States, such as my country, Greece. The new legislation, applicable throughout the European Union, provides for mandatory solidarity among Member States and a proportionate distribution of responsibilities. Additionally, it also provides for mandatory compensation from contributing countries to cover 100% of the needs of the Member State in crisis.

Secondly, to extend family reunification to include uncles, half-siblings, and partners encountered during their flight. Thirdly, to simplify and accelerate asylum procedures. Fourthly, to Westernize Eastern Europe through a redistribution mechanism. And fifthly, to replace the term \"illegal\" with \"irregular\" or \"disorderly\" migration.

In this Parliament, we have been elected to decide and legislate, not to indefinitely utter impassioned, but sterile speeches. We have been elected to assume the responsibility of making decisions. And I want to say that the alternative to not voting on each of the Regulations of this Pact is worse. It is not only condemning things to remain as they are, with all our protests, with every plenary session saying «shame, what a shame that the European Union continues to do nothing regarding the migratory phenomenon and the right to asylum». It is not recognising that we have tried and failed. It is something much worse and more disheartening for the future because it will be telling the voters: forget it, the European Union is not capable of responding even when it sets its mind to it and when it spends so many years on the effort. That is why I say: let us not lose the opportunity. It is now or never. After all these years of work, it is worth taking a step forward, with all its limitations, but also establishing order, guarantees, and common rules where there have been none until now. We are going to vote favourably on each of the Regulations of this European Pact.\n",

      "\tMadam President, I thank, above all, those who have attacked Eurodac. Their attacks are the main proof that we are right and that Eurodac goes to the heart of the problem. Illegal immigration is a business from which thousands of people are getting rich. Please, Members on this side , read the Frontex reports. The latest Frontex report literally states that human traffickers in Mauritania have been cramming increasingly large numbers of migrants into pirogues, which puts the lives of those on board in greater danger. Those who endanger people's lives are the traffickers and all those in Europe who call them to come, because these people are not fleeing persecution. In Africa, the only ones being persecuted are Christians murdered by jihadist militias, but you pay little attention to them. Look, on the Central Mediterranean route, protected by Italy, illegal immigration has fallen by 60%. On the Balkan route, protected by Hungary, illegal immigration has fallen by 70%. However, in the other two gateways to Europe —the Western Mediterranean and the Canary Islands route— it has increased by 50% and 540% during these two months of 2024. Yesterday, all Members of the Spanish Congress of Deputies —except those from my party— voted in favour of an amnesty for 500,000 illegal immigrants for an extraordinary regularisation. Why not a million? Thousands of illegal immigrants from Islamic countries are today on social media —the Commissioner will surely know this—, on Facebook, Twitter, and all social media, calling for massive entry into Europe via the Spanish route. This is the reality. These are all those subsidised entities, associations, and NGOs that have been blocking our emails for weeks in an unbearable campaign, but, if they live off illegal immigration, by what authority do they tell us what to vote for? We do not serve lobbies; we serve the voters. Eurodac has been the first stone of these foundations, and in the next legislative term, we will raise the pillars of a beautiful building where law, justice, and security prevail.\n",

      "\tMadam President, I have heard many arguments today, but the one I’ve heard most is: we have to have a deal. We just have to have a deal. But a deal must be judged on its contents. I repeat why we in The Left will vote against this deal. There is no solution to solidarity. There is no shared responsibility to receive asylum seekers. There is no stop to the death in the Mediterranean. Nothing. There will be systematic detention in the borders of Europe. The right to asylum will be dismantled. And there will be more deals with dictators and anti-democratic regimes. Just hear those arguments. So, in The Left, we stand for fundamental rights. We also stand with all those organisations that are demonstrating now outside this building. But they are also working every day to save lives, to demonstrate what it is with solidarity. Look at them and listen to them, please. People here like to say that we are anti-European; I would say you are anti-European. We defend a Europe that stands up for fundamental rights. What do you think people want in the future? What do you think the young people of Europe want? They want a Europe that stands for democracy, human rights, solidarity and fundamental rights. They want workers’ rights and they want climate justice. That’s the Europe they want to build, and they are not okay with us taking decisions that dismantle that future. You say we play into the hands of the far right. I would laugh if it wasn’t so serious. You are walking in their shoes. You are following on their leash, in their narrative, pitting people against each other, pitting migrants and refugees against workers, against young people, against families. You must stop. Instead, start to defend people’s rights – all people’s rights – because that’s the future that we have promised to build together for this Europe: a Europe that protects people, that doesn’t deny them rights. It starts anywhere. It starts everywhere. It starts today with refugee rights.\n",

      "\tMadam President, Honourable Members, thank you sincerely for this debate. This very clearly illustrates the state of the European Union today and also outlines the dangers that could befall Europe if we fail to adopt this package today. We all recognise that the entire package – the solution before us – is not perfect, but it is a compromise. However, there is no alternative to this package. If we were to reject it today, Europe would be plunged into great uncertainty. This would primarily embolden populist forces. Adopting the package is therefore a strategic necessity for the European Union and is our shared responsibility. And immediately afterwards, we will have to focus on implementation. Undoubtedly, there will also be certain challenges and difficulties in this process, and we will have to address them as they arise. There is simply no other way, Honourable Members. This is also what European citizens expect of us. In conclusion, therefore, I once again appeal to all colleagues: support the package! It is not ideal, but there is no alternative. Thank you to all colleagues for your support and cooperation.\n",

      "\tMadam President, as I stated earlier, I will support the package, but I will do so without joy. Now, every one of us in this room has his or her own reasons for voting in favour or against. And I’d like to say to the EPP: no, Greens and Left are not on the same side of the far right if they vote against. I think that’s dishonest. And no, friends of the Greens and Left, those voting in favour, like me, are not on the same side of the far right or anti-European. I have concerns and doubt, and I too struggle with the dilemma. But that is why we are in politics. Because having an opinion is easy. Voting for something perfect is not very difficult, but to take responsibility for dilemmas and difficult decisions is our job. The pact definitely contains problematic elements, risks and weaknesses and it is dishonest to deny that. But it is equally dishonest to claim that this pact is the end of the right to asylum, or that, in itself, it will lead to more violence at the borders. The violence today is not the result of the existing law, but of national policies and the absence of enforcement. I can defend the new Reception Conditions Directive without any hesitation, and those standards (which I had the pleasure to negotiate) will apply across the package. And if I had written the pact, it would look very different. But there will not be any fresh proposals on the table or a better negotiation result. It is false to create that impression and our job does not end here. We have an even bigger task in overseeing implementation and enforcement, and the best guarantee for European values is a solid majority of European liberal democrats who stand tall for human rights. So let’s make it happen in June.\n",

      "\tThe provisions of this migration pact try at all costs to create the impression that the problem with the influx of illegal migrants is controlled and orderly, and the situation – safe. Nothing could be further from the truth. I fear that only now will smugglers, these human traffickers, start behaving like sharks that have smelled blood. Because criminals driving this bloody business see the prospect of even greater profits from this illicit trade. Since Europe declares its readiness to accept illegal migrants, criminals will push them even more numerously onto dilapidated boats and propel them north towards Spain, Italy, or Greece. Fires are extinguished in the bud, and they are not extinguished with gasoline. That is why we proposed that aid for those in need be provided on the spot, in the countries from which migrants flee to Europe, but we were not listened to. We warned against creating once again the deceptive atmosphere of \"Herzlich willkommen,\" which did not prove effective even during Angela Merkel's time, and will certainly not prove effective now. The provisions of this pact will not help reduce the number of illegal migrants, but will further increase their influx into Europe. Even the authors of this document themselves have many doubts and do not hide their dissatisfaction with its provisions. This policy on migration must be decisively changed!\n",

      "\tChanges in human migration require reforms from Europe; relying on old regulations would not have been a solution. The package as a whole takes responsibility for more controlled migration, and even strict measures must be implementable when necessary. The Union is, however, also a continent where people can come and which is safe for them. The package also includes a crisis regulation, important for Finland, for situations where asylum seekers are instrumentalized as part of hybrid influencing. The situation at our eastern border has shown that we will need even more extensive tools for crises. I consider it important that we now get clear rules for the entire EU's Eastern border for situations where Russia seeks to instrumentalize asylum seekers through hybrid influencing. From Finland's perspective, this matter is particularly about national security. The package is a compromise where no one wins everything. The package now approved clarifies legislation as necessary and also aims to prevent organized crime, such as human smuggling. The new, updated rules are an improvement to the current unsustainable situation where old rules were not followed.\n",

      "\tIn 2015, at the peak of migratory pressure, when over 1.8 million irregular migrants entered the EU, Europe failed! Ten years later, Europe faces the second largest flow of migrants. In the first two months of 2024 alone, the number of people who illegally crossed the EU borders is over 30,000, the second highest level since the 2015–2016 crisis. The increase is by 541% on the West African route and by 117% on the Eastern Mediterranean route. Amidst all this, there is also positive news. Frontex reports a 70% decrease in the number of illegal border crossings on the Central Mediterranean route, and a 65% decrease on the Balkan route. Bulgaria, which guards one of the most challenging external borders, that with Turkey, also reports a decrease in migratory pressure. The country notes over a 40% decrease in the number of detained irregular migrants compared to the previous year. A prerequisite for this is the successful implementation of the pilot project with the Commission, which allows for a significant strengthening of border control capacity, accelerated asylum application procedures, and effective returns. For all this, Bulgaria was commended at a hearing of the LIBE Committee, where the Commission cited us as an example of good practices for the entire EU regarding the protection of external borders and migration management.\n",

      "\tAfter eight years of negotiations, an agreement has finally been reached on the migration and asylum policy package. This is a significant step. It is regrettable that some political groups are now attempting to derail this long-negotiated package after all these years. It is clear that the outcome is not perfect, but it unifies asylum policy and streamlines operations at the external borders. The collapse of the package would mean a continuation of the current situation, which is not functional for anyone. Responsibility for migration issues has been unevenly distributed for too long. All EU Member States must bear their share of this responsibility. The new rules now combine binding responsibility with flexibility, allowing Member States to choose their mode of participation. For Finland, as an external border country, it is particularly important that we have unified, efficient practices and information exchange at the EU borders, as well as mutual support among Member States. In the future, we will be better able to combat the abuse of the system. The guarantee of international protection must be ensured for those who need it. At the same time, unfounded applications must be efficiently screened, and necessary return decisions must be made. It is good that the package also provides more means to combat the instrumentalisation of migration in crisis situations, but it does not fully resolve it yet. This theme will likely need to be revisited. But now a significant common foundation has been laid. While the package is an important improvement to the current situation, it does not solve everything. For the future success of the entire EU, there is a great need to open more functional channels for labour migration. Europe is becoming the world's oldest continent, and millions of workers across the entire economic area will be retiring in the coming years. New experts, entrepreneurs, and workers are needed. In the future, there will be increasing competition for them, even within the EU.\n",

      "[ ] 3: Francisco José Millán Mon (PPE - christian_conservative) [0% migration]\n",
      "\tMr President, I thank Vice-President Schinas for his very comprehensive presentation. The European Union is going through a very serious situation. In the last two years, Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine has concentrated our efforts, but it cannot make us forget the Southern Neighbourhood. The serious risk of escalation in the Middle East, the difficulties faced by the countries of the Southern Neighbourhood, or the situation in the Sahel are profound challenges that the European Union cannot ignore. We must act. The agreements with Egypt, or the recent ones with Tunisia and Mauritania, are therefore heading in the right direction. Egypt is a very important neighbour, with significant geostrategic weight. The joint declaration of 17 March, promoted by President Von der Leyen, elevates our partnership with Egypt to a strategic level. This will facilitate political dialogue at the highest level, contribute to strengthening the country's stability, and improve its capacity to face current economic and security threats. Egypt is indeed experiencing a very difficult economic situation, marked by high public debt, elevated inflation, and a severe shortage of foreign currency. I hope that this partnership will contribute to stabilising the country's economy and promoting the necessary structural reforms. This partnership covers other equally important topics — as Vice-President Schinas told us — such as investments in energy, cooperation in the field of migration, or student exchanges — Erasmus+ —, among others. The promotion of democracy, human rights, and fundamental freedoms is also present in the partnership with Egypt. Ladies and gentlemen, Egypt has a great capacity for dialogue with Israel and Palestine. In the current difficult circumstances in the region, Egypt must continue working to achieve a ceasefire and the release of hostages, and to continue facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The European Union cannot aspire to be a global actor if, in its own neighbourhood, it is unable to actively defend its interests and values and act in a cohesive and effective manner. We must contribute decisively to the stability and prosperity of our neighbourhood, which is currently going through a very difficult period.\n",

      "\tMr President, Mr Commissioner, about a month ago, in this very room, as a member of the Committee on Budgets, I openly expressed my opposition to the use of an urgent procedure to make 150 million euros available to Tunisia. We were surprised. In March this year, the process is repeated, now with Egypt, for 7.4 million euros. Loans, investments, and aid for migration-related programmes. All of this without this Parliament exercising its role of democratic scrutiny. The way the European Commission bypassed this Parliament in concluding these agreements is unacceptable. It is inexplicable – and remains unexplained – how agreements of this nature, which must have involved lengthy preparation, do not pass through Parliament? We want to know what conditionalities – beyond the general conditionalities – the Commission established with these agreements with Tunisia and now with Egypt. Was there urgency? We cannot validate these agreements under the argument of urgency, because that is not true. Today we have a new Pact on Asylum and Migration. The European Parliament demonstrated throughout the 9th legislative term that it can act quickly. We did so, for example, in the European response to COVID-19. The European Parliament is the budgetary authority. It does not relinquish its powers, and we cannot think that it is through urgent disbursements that we will become relevant in the Southern Neighbourhood. This is a very limited and very unstrategic view of the problem.\n",
      "[ ] 5: Jan-Christoph Oetjen (ELDR/ALDE/Renew - liberal) [5% migration]\n",
      "\tMr President, Mr Commissioner, honourable colleagues! Egypt has historically long been an important partner for us, the European Union, in the region. And it is right that we conclude comprehensive agreements with such strategic partners, covering all policy areas. However, I find it particularly important to emphasise that it is stipulated that financial support for Egypt is tied to the fulfilment of conditions. The conditions mentioned therein are concrete steps towards effective democratic mechanisms. And it is absolutely right that such conditions exist, honourable colleagues. Unfortunately, in my view, it is not concrete enough as it is written here. One thing is clear: Today, there is virtually no opportunity for civil society in Egypt to express itself openly and critically about the current government.

And regarding migration management, it must also be absolutely clear, in my view, that human rights are non-negotiable, honourable colleagues.

The anomaly is that after two resolutions voted here condemning the actions of the Sisi government, you decided to sign contracts for 7.5 billion. As the standing rapporteur for Egypt in this institution, I have consistently called for strong and precise conditionalities regarding this regime. Through your sleight of hand, Ms von der Leyen ended up receiving a very clear recommendation from the Council. The Council asks you to implement concrete conditionalities in your report to the Sisi regime. If you have no ideas, I will give you some: lift censorship on independent media, release the 60,000 prisoners, stop the pressure on civil society and the opposition, protect sexual equality and the rights of minorities, migrants, and refugees. Today, Mr Commissioner, 18 women were arrested by the Sisi regime because they were demonstrating in front of the United Nations office with a simple petition on the situation in Gaza and Sudan. Where are human rights in this country? Where are the commitments of this regime? After having disregarded Parliament, will Ms von der Leyen also disregard the Council and its recommendations? Stop your hidden agenda. Stop this morbid project which aims to transform the European Union into a World Bank for dictatorships and authoritarian regimes.

      "\tMr President, Egypt is an essential partner for France and the European Union in Africa. Cairo is currently facing immense challenges. Egypt must strive for food, energy, economic, and financial sovereignty, amidst a particularly degraded neighbourhood. The European Union therefore has everything to gain by standing alongside it. While everyone acknowledges Cairo's decisive role in the pursuit of peace in the Holy Land, Egypt's actions are also beneficial elsewhere, both for its region and for the European Union. In Sudan, Egypt plays an essential humanitarian and diplomatic role, while also hosting refugees from the civil war tearing the country apart. At its Libyan border, Egypt ensures the fight against terrorism, just as it has done for years in the Sinai. While the dark hours of the country's domination by Mohammed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood have barely faded, Cairo has regained its pivotal role in international negotiations. I can therefore only welcome Egypt's participation in the Horizon Europe programme. I hope this progress heralds further advancements, particularly regarding a partnership for migration prevention. This is also an excellent signal for European businesses, which benefit from the new prospects opening up in this territory. France is already at the forefront of projects related to the Cairo Metro, but would benefit from investing more in developing Egyptian markets, such as the construction of the New Cairo city. In Egypt, due to strong demographic pressure, immense construction projects are flourishing, in which our businesses must be supported. As competition rages with Chinese, American, and Arab groups, it is important that European companies play a leading role in the country. At the heart of the emergence of a multipolar world, the European Union must support the intensification of its relations with its historical partners. While this parliamentary term has been marked by several resolutions, which were particularly ill-received by the Egyptian Parliament and numerous associations, I can only express my delight at concluding this final plenary session with good news for our relations with Egypt.\n",

Secondly, this agreement is potentially controversial, as it evidently has no legal force whatsoever, nor does it contain any safeguards regarding the respect for human rights.

But we must ask ourselves whether Europe is part of the solution or part of the problem. And at whose expense it concludes such agreements and who it might potentially harm. It would be unacceptable for Europe, without adequate safeguards, to contribute in any way to the violation of human rights and the suppression of democracy and the rule of law.

This agreement was not only signed bypassing the scrutiny of the European Parliament, but it completely ignores the grave rule of law situation in Egypt. Indeed, cooperation with this country cannot be separated from our demand for human rights to be respected, by guaranteeing freedom of expression, releasing arbitrarily detained persons, and ending the repression of minorities. This was reminded to us just in these days, here in the European Parliament, by the presence of Patrick Zaki, detained for months by the Egyptian regime and now finally free, who told us: \"If I am here, it is because you too, in these chambers, believed that fighting for my freedom was a battle to be won.\" Giulio Regeni's parents also ask this of us, he who died more than eight years ago in Egypt and for whom we are still seeking the truth. A truth that the Egyptian authorities continue to cover up and which the Italian government and European authorities should demand with much greater force. Indeed, yes, fighting for freedom and for truth is a battle to be won. And as Europe, we must continue to do so.

Women and girls, in particular, have faced escalating restrictions on their fundamental rights, such as limited access to education, mobility and employment, effectively erasing them from public life. The recent public executions of three individuals, along with the Taliban’s discriminatory restrictions and harsh penalties, are deeply disturbing. The Taliban’s draconian crackdown on dissent and non-compliance with their strict dress code is a clear violation of human rights. It is crucial that we condemn these actions and demand accountability from the de facto authorities in Afghanistan. As the EU, we have a responsibility to address these continuous human rights violations and support the Afghan people, especially women and girls, in their pursuit of justice and freedom. We must fully support the establishment of an international accountability mechanism to collect and preserve evidence of serious violations in Afghanistan. This will be essential for future criminal proceedings and ensuring justice for the victims of human rights abuses.

This without a resolution for tonight, this Wednesday evening, with a speaking slot per political group. And I ask, Madam President, that this be carried out by roll-call vote.\n",

It's simple: on November 16th, the Member States are expected to validate the European Commission's proposal to renew the glyphosate license for an additional ten years. We refuse it. We say stop to glyphosate because when so many independent studies denounce the toxicity of this product for human health, well, reauthorizing glyphosate is criminal. When so many other studies denounce the devastation caused by this herbicide on nature and biodiversity, reauthorizing glyphosate is a betrayal. We must urgently guarantee the protection of our health and of living things by immediately and definitively turning the page on glyphosate. This is a major public health issue. We only have one life. Let's defend it together. So, colleagues, I propose that we add to tomorrow morning's agenda, at 8:30 a.m., a debate with a resolution entitled 'Declaration by the Commission and the Council on the renewal of glyphosate and the urgent need for a phase-out'. This debate would be organized with one speaker per political group, and I would like two separate votes: one on holding the debate and the other on adopting a resolution.\n",

Already in October 2017, this Parliament asked the Commission to ban glyphosate no later than 15 December 2022. Glyphosate is ruining our health and the health of animals. It is polluting our environment, soils and water sources. We don’t need another resolution. We don’t need a phase-out as proposed by the Greens. We need to ban glyphosate now. Therefore, I would like to make a counter-proposal: I ask for a debate without a resolution, and I propose as a title of the debate ‘the need for an immediate ban on glyphosate’.

      "\tMadam President, Your Excellency Mr President, dear colleagues, I would like to welcome the President of my country in this House, which in the European Union has the strongest institutional adherence to European values of democracy, human rights, liberty, solidarity and respect to dignity of each human being, despite what is his or her colour of the skin, and what is his or her sexual or political orientation. The European Union will be strong if it will be based on those values without compromises, if it will be based on those values not only here in the European Parliament or in some other EU institutions, but also on a national, regional and local level. This is the only way how those values can be established also on the whole European continent. Why is it so important to talk about those basic principles and values? Because this is the only way how sustainable peace can be established on the European continent, since there is a very well—known law of geopolitics: only democracies are not fighting with each other. That is why defence of those values everywhere in our Union and the spread of democracy and basic human values into the eastern side of European continent is the most important strategic geopolitical goal for all of us, and especially during this war. We need to recognise, all of us in the European Union: we are not perfect back home in this area. There are things which we need to improve and to strengthen, also in Lithuania. But today I want to elaborate on what our President was speaking about. What should our common strategic agenda be in order to assist the nations in the eastern part of the European continent to enjoy the same European values of democracy and human rights? I want to repeat: sustainable peace on European continent will be established only when Belarusian and Russian people will have a possibility to enjoy those values and to live in normal European conditions. Such a strategic agenda will be implemented only if we shall proceed with a very clear strategic action plan. First, Ukraine needs to decisively defeat Putin’s Russia during this year, and that will create possibilities for big political changes in Russia and Belarus. Our most important obligation: weapons, weapons, weapons… and sanctions. Second, the absolute geopolitical priority for you during this year: to start membership negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova. That would be the most powerful European geopolitical answer to Kremlin hybrid offensive activities in the region, especially in Moldova and perhaps also in Georgia. Third, the integration of Ukraine, Moldova and possibly Georgia towards the EU should be concluded till the end of this decade, since that is the only way how successful and prosperous democracies can be created in those countries. The success of those countries would be an inspiration for Belarusian and Russian societies to follow. Fourth, Ukraine needs to get membership in NATO, if not during the Vilnius summit this year, then during the Washington summit next year. It would help Russian people to abandon their dream to restore empire because Ukraine will be gone. Fifth, the EU needs to show clear perspective. Democratic Belarus will have possibility to integrate into the EU. Democratic Russia will have a special and very practical relationship with the EU. We Lithuanians want to be part of a European Union which is able to implement such a democracy action plan because this is an action plan for sustainable peace on the European continent.\n",

      "\tEsteemed President of Lithuania, Madam President, distinguished colleagues, European citizens observing our discussion, Lithuania, like other countries of similar fate that were destined to experience the oppression and aggression of Soviet totalitarian Russia, knows better than anyone the price of freedom won with blood. Today, Ukraine is in this same position, heroically fighting for its own freedom and ours. It is fighting against the same aggressor, only with a changed name. It is therefore no surprise that from the first day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine until now, the voice of Lithuania and other Baltic States has been the loudest, urging not only the provision of urgent and comprehensive assistance to Ukraine, but also demanding a common and united European Union response to stop Russia's aggression. Here and now. Allow me to remind you that for many years, Lithuania and other Baltic States consistently spoke and warned about the true face of Russia and the objectives of its authoritarian Putin regime. Unfortunately, not all members of the European community were willing to heed these warnings. However, these warnings have become a bloody reality for the people of Ukraine. Today, everyone has acknowledged that the discourse of Lithuania and the Baltic States concerning the bloody objectives of the Kremlin regime was not merely an airing of historical grievances. We did this because we knew how fragile freedom is and how immense its price is, and we aimed to prevent this from happening again in Europe, and to ensure that no nation would ever experience brutal oppression and an assault on its territorial integrity and freedom. Never. I fully agree with our President. Historical memory must not be relegated to the archives. History must not be forgotten, and the war initiated by Putin bears witness to this once again. Therefore, I call upon us to be responsible, united, and courageous, to establish a tribunal for Russia's war crimes, to take all possible actions and impose sanctions to weaken the power of the Kremlin regime, and to help Ukraine win this brutal war, as this is also a guarantor of Europe's long-term security. We must be united in restoring and expanding our defensive capabilities – our security as Europeans will depend on how we pursue this together, jointly, and in a concerted manner. Distinguished colleagues, a strong and resilient Europe can only exist when it is united, socially responsible, just, and progressive. Our goal as socialists and democrats is to strengthen Europe's social foundation and to ensure that the objectives approved at the Porto Summit are fully implemented in all member states. A Social Europe must ensure that even those on minimal incomes can live with dignity and support their families, rather than falling into poverty; that there are no children living in poverty, of whom we still have over 18 million in Europe today; that men and women receive equal pay for the same work; that our pensioners enjoy a dignified old age; and that the rights and freedoms of all people are protected. Only a socially strong, resilient, and responsible Europe will be able to cope with challenges such as the green transition and digitalization, which will inevitably impact Europe's socio-economic model and labor market. However, our people must be at the forefront of all reforms. So, courageously and united for Europe!\n",

But what truly moves the world is what one puts on the table when truth obliges us: money, resources, people one accepts as immigrants.

      "\tMadam President, first of all I wish to welcome the President to the European Parliament and, most importantly – even if we are a bit late – to say ‘Happy Independence Restoration Day’ to Lithuania, of course. More than anything, colleagues, the full—scale invasion of Ukraine has confirmed the need for European unity. And it is true that only together, as Europeans, can we stand up against the brutal imperialism of the Russian regime. We have shown here in the European Parliament that we stand for unwavering solidarity with Ukraine, be it financial, humanitarian, or military support, paving the way for Ukraine to become a member of the European Union. But of course, and you have mentioned it, Mr President, we need full energy independence of the brutal Russian regime. For too long politicians also, and especially from my home country, Germany, have ignored the alert for from our eastern neighbours, like, for example, Lithuania, and now we are paying a high price for this. But colleagues, one thing has to be understood. Simply switching from one energy dependency on one dictatorship to another will not solve any of our problems. Nor does the shift from one fossil fuel dependency to another non-renewable energy source. The only sustainable answer that will prevent us from having the exact same problem that we have been facing in the last year again, in two, five or ten years is to make our energy consumption 100% renewable. That is possible and we have no time to lose. No country in the European Union will manage this alone. Only a strong European Green Deal can make that possible. You are absolutely right. The Green Deal for long already has not only been a measure that we need to protect our climate or to stimulate our economy, it has become the most crucial measure also for strong security in the European continent. But, Mr President, the fight against authoritarianism does not only happen, unfortunately, outside of the European Union. We also have to stay vigilant inside because we can see attempts of undermining our democracy, of undermining separation of powers, rule of law and fundamental rights in the European Union, brutal attacks on press freedom and journalists. We cannot stay silent in the European Union on these developments because the EU is not only a community of trade – we share fundamental values. If we want the EU to be strong and true to its own values, we have to protect all our citizens from these attacks, no matter whether they are from Lithuania or Portugal, no matter their gender, their skin colour or their sexual orientation. Because safeguarding freedom and human dignity means safeguarding freedom and human dignity for all.\n",

      "\tEsteemed Mr. President! Today's war in Ukraine poses a threat to international security and is the cause of an economic crisis. Lasting peace is a supreme value. Lasting peace is also essential, as is solidarity, which would allow us to survive this difficult time. However, there is a big problem today with European solidarity, because some large countries pursue their own, egoistic policies. The Union is also experiencing a crisis of values, those values that once built the Community, and from which we are unfortunately departing. I am saying this primarily to the EU institutions, where there is no development of democracy and free political thought. Unfortunately, an artificial power arrangement blocks the development of freedom, blocks in defiance of democracy, as the will of a large part of the electorate, up to 50%, is rejected. Today's arrangement unites a single goal – power at any cost and the division of \"posts\". This is a peculiar usurpation of democracy. The two main forces in this Parliament – the EPP and the Socialists – although theoretically having different programmes, have for years united immediately after elections to exclude a third force, and in this way do not have to deliver on their programmes. The Socialists promise social programmes but do not implement them. They promise to care for the poorest but support CO2 emissions trading, which causes price increases and the impoverishment of people. The EPP declares that it upholds Christian values, but does not defend life from conception to natural death, does not protect marriage understood as a union between a woman and a man, and often supports gender ideology, which has nothing to do with true Christian Democracy. Additionally, both forces impose the creation of an EU federation, which destroys the Europe of nations that it was intended to be in the vision of its founders, Schuman and others. Unfortunately, this artificial political arrangement blocks free thought and ideas. The EPP-Socialist arrangement does not allow for any alternative, the so-called third force. Such a system encourages political corruption, which we are witnessing in Parliament. This harmful and undemocratic practice is also being transferred to the level of member states. Even our President Gitanas Nausėda is being attacked, and his election challenged, although he received 67% of the votes. This is not conducive to democracy. Europe is becoming an ideological void due to the EPP and Socialist arrangement. It is in disarray. Therefore, in the name of true European solidarity, a third or fourth force is needed that will be able to heal Europe, to restore its true face based on its roots. It is precisely the ECR that is the force that recognises this and wants to change it, as we discussed recently at summits in Warsaw and Madrid. We also spoke about the need to strengthen Europe's energy independence and the development of its own industry, including heavy and defence industries. In accordance with this idea, today we would not be facing problems with our defence capabilities in an era of aggression in Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! Europe and the Union need more democracy and freedom based on Christian values, the traditional family, and free thought, because such is the true soul of Europe.\n",

      "\tMadam President, President Nausėda of Lithuania, first of all I am more than happy to be here as from one from the Baltic States, from Estonia. And I really appreciate your several statements that Latvia and Lithuania have been together in history and the good and also in the bad times If we just remind the history, it was pretty easy for Russia — they called it the Soviet Union at the time but it was Russia, the same thing — to break down each country one by one because all those three countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, had their own some kind of policy. And for Moscow, it wasn’t very hard to have some kind of deals each by each. And the result we know pretty well and it’s just experience for the history. If you try to make some kind of deals with Satan, you are the loser from the beginning, there is no chance. To remind some of the necessity of the support to Ukraine. We all agree, most of us agree here. And there is different kind of ways to help Ukraine. But the most necessary definitely is military aid. As we can see in the news, the next weeks and the next months will be very crucial in Ukraine because both sides haven’t won. And if somebody’s saying that there is no winner in the war, there is. The winner can be only Ukraine, because if they lose we will be the next ones. And there is no question about that. As I looked just on the statistics, the resources, those three Baltic states have given the biggest military and financial aid to Ukraine. Estonia with 1%, Latvia with 0.98%, Lithuania with 0.65% of the GDP. And the fourth one is Poland with 0.63%. At the same time, there has been very huge help from the US and from the UK. But they can do more. And the problem for us now is that we really don’t have a lot yet to really give to Ukraine. But there are much more to give from the US, from the UK, also from Germany and France. Germany has given 0.17% of the GDP, France 0.07% of the GDP. Those are just cold facts and numbers. And now the question is: are they really brave enough to make this change in the war or not? Because if we will lose this momentum now, in the next month, we will face the new war in the next two or three years. So just a moment to think which kind of chances we have if somebody is talking about the peace negotiations. The peace can be only if the conditions are good for us. And the only conditions that are good for us can be that there is no ambitions for Russia to start any kind of aggression in next decades. I will not say ‘forever’. We shouldn’t be very naive. Russia will not disappear. But the only thing what we can do is just to weaken them as much as possible and to show that they cannot win their neighbours. And finally, I would like to really thank you that Lithuania was one of the countries two years ago who showed how to deal with illegal migration. There is no question that if you are the war refugee, you need help. There is no doubt. But what we saw in Belarus, it was just illegal migration, what was used by Belarus for the hybrid attacks. And Lithuania, together with Poland, just shut down the border and said ‘there is no way to enter to the European countries through those countries illegally’, because if you open the border, there would be no ending, no ending at all. And you did absolutely well. So labai ačiū, thank you so much. And good luck for the Baltic cooperation.\n",

To achieve these goals, we need a European Union that is not just a common market and \"a bit of a political union\". We need a stronger Community budget, larger than 1% of European GDP, with more own resources, with more money for reducing social inequalities, which have increased, to support the poorest countries and the poorest social categories, to implement the Green Deal; a European Union that must remain a project of peace and democracy. Because democracy is suffering even within the European Union: in Poland and in Hungary, unfortunately also in my homeland Greece, and I do not think, Mr President, that you yourself are satisfied that democracy is at its best in Lithuania either. Therefore, we must respect the rule of law and avoid the risk of paralysis in the Council, where unanimity often becomes a weapon in the hands of blackmailers, of governments that block the functioning of the European Union to extort, to achieve something for their own interests. Regarding enlargement, let us be honest. Let us not promise the peoples of Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine things that require years and changes and conditions. Beware!

They were occupied and they remained independent. I remember that, in 1987, our Prime Minister, from our party, Cavaco Silva – who was Prime Minister ten years and President of the Republic ten years – had a huge conflict with the Parliament because he didn’t agree with a visit to the Soviet Union, where the territories of Baltic states were included.

And today, Mr President, we are very proud because your country became a world front runner of defence, of democracy, of freedom, of human rights. This was clear when you sent all the support to the Ukrainian people, but also when you are claiming for democracy in Belarus and when you are saying that you don’t accept the blackmail of China. The example of the Ukrainian solidarity shows that you want for other countries in Europe, and I dare say in world, the same fate that Lithuania had, which was in a very, very oppressive regime and managed to become independent and to give freedom, prosperity and human rights’ respect to all the citizens.

And yet, for the concrete problems that the peoples face – exacerbated by the policies of sanctions, sector liberalization, production concentration, precariousness, and low wages promoted by the European Union – solutions continue to be lacking. Where are the measures to reverse the increase in poverty and halt the indecent concentration of wealth? Where are the measures to curb the loss of purchasing power and the brutal increase in the cost of living? What are the measures to put an end to the exploitation and speculation of large economic and financial groups and their obscene profits? What initiatives are there to invest in public services and defend universal and solidarity-based social security? What proposals are there to put an end to the assault on labour rights, the increase in exploitation, precariousness, and the deregulation of working hours? The peoples want peace, they want what is being denied to them. In Portugal, as across Europe, the mobilization of populations, of workers, is intensifying. Actions demanding the right to a dignified life, to work with rights, to increased wages are multiplying. For an end to speculation and profiteering, for intervention in markets, for the setting of maximum prices. For the right to health, to education, to housing. For peace.

And we hear your government justify these violations under the misguided arguments of fighting instrumentalisation. But what you are doing is fighting innocent victims in need of protection.

All of this at a time when our freedom was not taken for granted and when it was challenged by many, primarily by stronger and larger neighbors. Both Croatia and Ukraine suffered aggression. Croatia defended itself, liberated itself, and today knows very well what Ukraine is going through: years of prepared aggression, strong propaganda attacks, but also the orchestration and support of internal rebellion. This is what Ukraine is experiencing today, this is what Croatia survived, and essentially, all of this was prepared, perhaps in different forms, for the Baltic states as well. In the past decade, the Baltic states have felt disinformation attacks, as well as attacks on their digital infrastructure. Ukraine also suffers most from attacks on civilian infrastructure today. Croatia, although far from any military threat, is still exposed to various cultural encroachments today. Although we are different in many ways and at different historical moments, one thing is very much common to us: we know who we are, we know what our values are, and we know where we belong.

You mentioned not only the Russian dictator, but also the Belarusian one. Almost one and a half thousand political prisoners are held in inhumane conditions in Belarus. Therefore, I would like to ask that the European Council, together with the urging of the European Parliament, does everything possible to ensure that political prisoners are released, including Ales Bialiatski, Maria Kalesnikava, Mikalai Statkevich, and others. Nevertheless, despite the crisis caused by Russia's aggression in the economy and other sectors, and the resilience of our citizens, some are profiting from that crisis. We have seen enormous excess profits in the energy sector, and in some parts of the pharmaceutical and banking sectors. I believe that common efforts are needed to curb these excess profits and for the funds to be allocated to the most necessary defence and the creation of a welfare state.

However, European legislation does not recognise a legal instrument for the protection of non-food traditional products, and Croatian cultural heritage abounds in such products.

Pag lace, the Šibenik button, or Slavonian gold embroidery are just some of the traditional jewels of our region whose manufacturing technique has been carefully preserved and passed down from generation to generation.

Why do they want to make life more complicated and duller for ordinary people? It's not dangerous to have fresh teeth. It's not dangerous to smell good. So stop this nonsense now and leave people alone!\n",

      "\tMr. President, regarding Portugal's GDP growth last year, the highest since 1987, two points. First, this growth is accompanied by the largest fall in the share of wages in GDP during the same period. Real wages have decreased, workers have lost purchasing power, many are becoming poorer while working. Economic groups are increasing their profits, increasing inequalities and injustices. This reality is inseparable from the guidelines, pressures, and impositions of the European Union, to which successive governments have submitted, from attacks on collective bargaining, from public sector wage restrictions, from underinvestment in public services and in the social functions of the State. Second, despite the economic bias of this growth and the exceptional circumstances explaining it, it exposes the absurdity of insisting on debt reduction through budget surpluses and the dictatorship of the deficit. As proven, economic growth is the path to faster and more sustained debt reduction.\n",

      "\tMr President, despite the police having been given free rein, appointees of former Smer governments and their patrons are still protected in Slovakia. The Prosecutor General shamelessly uses Article 363 to quash prosecutions, especially when the accused are friends, family, appointees, sponsors, or fellow party members of former Prime Ministers Fico and Pellegrini. He even used this legal loophole to drop charges against Robert Fico himself and Robert Kaliňák. The scenario is the same every time: just before the investigation findings are submitted to court, the Prosecutor General uses Article 363, and the corruption charges are dropped. The police even produced a video from a hunting lodge, in which Robert Fico himself boasts precisely about his coordination with the Prosecutor General. There are therefore reasonable suspicions that the Prosecutor General abuses this legal loophole in favour of the cronies of Smer and Hlas. Shamelessly, he also fails to see a criminal offence related to the kidnapping of a Vietnamese national, who was brought from Germany to Slovakia and from where he was secretly transported to Russia by government jet. While in Germany, all who cooperated in this kidnapping were convicted, in Slovakia, the Prosecutor General still sees no reason for criminal prosecution. What is a criminal offence in Germany is not a criminal offence in Slovakia.\n",

      "\tPresident, on the night of 20 to 21 July 2020, French President Macron's plane was warming up at Brussels airport. The negotiations surrounding the European Corona Emergency Fund were over. Prime Minister Mark Rutte had said no. The Netherlands refused to pay for an EU recovery plan. But then it happened! European Council President Charles Michel's phone rang. It was Prime Minister Rutte. On the orders of his D66 Deputy Prime Minister Sigrid Kaag, he still wanted to negotiate. Result: over EUR 800 billion in common EU debt, on account of the Netherlands' AAA guarantee. Today, Macron comes begging again, this time for a green industry fund. Again, Mark Rutte says no. But who believes him anymore? President, it really must be different. Member States and governments must take their own responsibility. The Dutch taxpayer cannot continue to do that for them. For JA21, it is no, and it remains no.\n",

      "\tMr President, on 6 March last year the security services of Ukraine, the SBU, arrested the First Secretary of the Ukrainian Komsomol, Mikhail Kononovich, and his brother, Aleksander. They were accused of treason and spreading pro-Russian views. These two young communists are subjected to physical and psychological torture, beatings, lashings, sleep deprivation and threats of execution. Political repression of communists, peace activists and progressive forces is common in both Ukraine and Russia. If Russians do it, it’s a travesty. Yet, when Ukrainians do it, it is to spread democracy and representing European values. Member States are divided on speeding up accession for Ukraine, and rightly so. The level of corruption is comical. The Zelenskyy government empowers far-right extremists and neo-Nazis while destroying workers’ rights and banning 12 opposition parties – and, as we can see from the case of the Kononovich brothers, are busy persecuting them. We cannot just ignore this oppression! We can start by calling for the release of these two men.\n",

      "\tToday I wish to address a topic concerning Serbia, a state that aspires to join the European Union. However, when it embarked on this path, Romania made the respect of this status conditional on the granting of rights to national minorities. The Romanian minority is extremely numerous in this country, but fundamental rights continue to be curtailed. And here I want to pay tribute to the vicar of the Romanian Orthodox Church in Serbia, specifically of the \"Dacia Ripensis\" Deanery in the Timok Valley, Eastern Serbia, who has been extremely heavily persecuted by the authorities throughout his 20 years of activity. I assure him of my full respect, and I believe that Serbia must join the European Union, but it has an obligation to respect all its citizens, including the Romanian minority.\n",

      "\tIt is up to us alone how we arrange our common European home. Whether it will be strong and based on principles, or weak and stripped of its values. Yes, the Union is a home, and our role is to strengthen this home. This is why we were elected: to ensure it is secured against enemies, to protect the weakest, and for its inhabitants to live in harmony and prosperity. However, in this home of ours, there are those who slander the family and carry out the family silver. Such people are here. Some torpedo sanctions against Putin and do not provide weapons to Ukraine; others, day after day, spit on the Union, replicating Kremlin propaganda. This is the moment in Europe's history when a stronger and more integrated Union is needed. Firstly, an end to the pathological veto rule in the Council, which allows Orbán to block sanctions. Secondly, energy independence for the entire European Union. Thirdly, Putin's nightmare: a common European army and a common foreign policy. A strong European Union means a secure future for millions of Europeans.\n",

      "\tMr President, many mountain regions, but also structurally disadvantaged regions, poor regions, continue to decline, becoming depopulated, as if they had no future. They are not attractive for young people, development is rather stagnant, and at the same time, it must be said that these regions are essentially abandoned, abandoned within our European Union. It seems as if cohesion policy is failing in some areas, as if our Just Transition Fund has not functioned as we imagine. Unfortunately, many regions, on the contrary, function like a funnel, like a growth pole, where everyone wants to live. I believe we must address these issues of our cohesion regional policy's failure much better than we have done so far. It is important to make agriculture more attractive; it is important to find attractive, lucrative work and opportunities for many companies in these regions. Otherwise, our rural areas will become depopulated and stagnant.\n",

      "\tMr President, I had my name on the list. I was told that there wasn’t enough time and there were too many speakers, but we’ve only had 27. We still have time and some people didn’t turn up. So I’m just wondering what the story is. I can go on? Thank you so much, I really appreciate it, you are a gentleman. Italian anarchist Alfredo Cospito is on his 105th day of hunger strike against the ‘41—bis’ prison regime under which he is incarcerated. It’s a prison regime which authorises the violation of human rights: no phone calls, no parcels, no mixing with other prisoners, 22—hour lockup, one visit a month; a prison regime condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for breaching two of its articles. Yet this regime continues to exist in an EU Member State, unchallenged in our so-called democracies. Alfredo has lost over 40 kilos. His potassium levels have dropped. He will die unless action is taken. The Minister for Justice, who must rule on the revocation by 12 February 12, has said he’s going to leave the decision to the judiciary until 7 March. This is a death sentence. Alfredo doesn’t have that time left. So the question is, will the EU remain silent? This is a human rights issue. Over 200 jurists and lawyers have condemned his treatment. 41—bis must be revoked.\n",

      "\tMr President, I thank Vice-President Schinas for his very comprehensive presentation. The European Union is going through a very serious situation. In the last two years, Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine has concentrated our efforts, but it cannot make us forget the Southern Neighbourhood. The serious risk of escalation in the Middle East, the difficulties faced by the countries of the Southern Neighbourhood, or the situation in the Sahel are profound challenges that the European Union cannot ignore. We must act. The agreements with Egypt, or the recent ones with Tunisia and Mauritania, are therefore heading in the right direction. Egypt is a very important neighbour, with significant geostrategic weight. The joint declaration of 17 March, promoted by President Von der Leyen, elevates our partnership with Egypt to a strategic level. This will facilitate political dialogue at the highest level, contribute to strengthening the country's stability, and improve its capacity to face current economic and security threats. Egypt is indeed experiencing a very difficult economic situation, marked by high public debt, elevated inflation, and a severe shortage of foreign currency. I hope that this partnership will contribute to stabilising the country's economy and promoting the necessary structural reforms. This partnership covers other equally important topics — as Vice-President Schinas told us — such as investments in energy, cooperation in the field of migration, or student exchanges — Erasmus+ —, among others. The promotion of democracy, human rights, and fundamental freedoms is also present in the partnership with Egypt. Ladies and gentlemen, Egypt has a great capacity for dialogue with Israel and Palestine. In the current difficult circumstances in the region, Egypt must continue working to achieve a ceasefire and the release of hostages, and to continue facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The European Union cannot aspire to be a global actor if, in its own neighbourhood, it is unable to actively defend its interests and values and act in a cohesive and effective manner.

We were surprised. In March this year, the process is repeated, now with Egypt, for 7.4 million euros. Loans, investments, and aid for migration-related programmes. All of this without this Parliament exercising its role of democratic scrutiny. The way the European Commission bypassed this Parliament in concluding these agreements is unacceptable. It is inexplicable – and remains unexplained – how agreements of this nature, which must have involved lengthy preparation, do not pass through Parliament? We want to know what conditionalities – beyond the general conditionalities – the Commission established with these agreements with Tunisia and now with Egypt. Was there urgency? We cannot validate these agreements under the argument of urgency, because that is not true. Today we have a new Pact on Asylum and Migration. The European Parliament demonstrated throughout the 9th legislative term that it can act quickly. We did so, for example, in the European response to COVID-19. The European Parliament is the budgetary authority. It does not relinquish its powers, and we cannot think that it is through urgent disbursements that we will become relevant in the Southern Neighbourhood. This is a very limited and very unstrategic view of the problem.\n",

And it is right that we conclude comprehensive agreements with such strategic partners, covering all policy areas. However, I find it particularly important to emphasise that it is stipulated that financial support for Egypt is tied to the fulfilment of conditions. The conditions mentioned therein are concrete steps towards effective democratic mechanisms. And it is absolutely right that such conditions exist, honourable colleagues. Unfortunately, in my view, it is not concrete enough as it is written here. One thing is clear: Today, there is virtually no opportunity for civil society in Egypt to express itself openly and critically about the current government. In my view, structural reforms for more human rights and a functioning rule of law are urgently needed in Egypt. And regarding migration management, it must also be absolutely clear, in my view, that human rights are non-negotiable, honourable colleagues. The documented abuses that also occur in Egypt, for example, involving refugees from Sudan, must be investigated and must not form the basis for cooperation between the European Union and Egypt.\n",

The anomaly is that after two resolutions voted here condemning the actions of the Sisi government, you decided to sign contracts for 7.5 billion. As the standing rapporteur for Egypt in this institution, I have consistently called for strong and precise conditionalities regarding this regime. Through your sleight of hand, Ms von der Leyen ended up receiving a very clear recommendation from the Council. The Council asks you to implement concrete conditionalities in your report to the Sisi regime. If you have no ideas, I will give you some: lift censorship on independent media, release the 60,000 prisoners, stop the pressure on civil society and the opposition, protect sexual equality and the rights of minorities, migrants, and refugees. Today, Mr Commissioner, 18 women were arrested by the Sisi regime because they were demonstrating in front of the United Nations office with a simple petition on the situation in Gaza and Sudan. Where are human rights in this country? Where are the commitments of this regime? After having disregarded Parliament, will Ms von der Leyen also disregard the Council and its recommendations?

      "\tMr President, Egypt is an essential partner for France and the European Union in Africa. Cairo is currently facing immense challenges. Egypt must strive for food, energy, economic, and financial sovereignty, amidst a particularly degraded neighbourhood. The European Union therefore has everything to gain by standing alongside it. While everyone acknowledges Cairo's decisive role in the pursuit of peace in the Holy Land, Egypt's actions are also beneficial elsewhere, both for its region and for the European Union. In Sudan, Egypt plays an essential humanitarian and diplomatic role, while also hosting refugees from the civil war tearing the country apart. At its Libyan border, Egypt ensures the fight against terrorism, just as it has done for years in the Sinai. While the dark hours of the country's domination by Mohammed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood have barely faded, Cairo has regained its pivotal role in international negotiations. I can therefore only welcome Egypt's participation in the Horizon Europe programme. I hope this progress heralds further advancements, particularly regarding a partnership for migration prevention. This is also an excellent signal for European businesses, which benefit from the new prospects opening up in this territory. France is already at the forefront of projects related to the Cairo Metro, but would benefit from investing more in developing Egyptian markets, such as the construction of the New Cairo city. In Egypt, due to strong demographic pressure, immense construction projects are flourishing, in which our businesses must be supported. As competition rages with Chinese, American, and Arab groups, it is important that European companies play a leading role in the country. At the heart of the emergence of a multipolar world, the European Union must support the intensification of its relations with its historical partners. While this parliamentary term has been marked by several resolutions, which were particularly ill-received by the Egyptian Parliament and numerous associations, I can only express my delight at concluding this final plenary session with good news for our relations with Egypt.\n",

This agreement with Egypt is problematic from several perspectives. Firstly, because it is once again merely a press statement and not an international agreement with the EU. The complete disregard for the European Parliament and, not least, its budgetary function, has evidently become standard practice for the Commission. Secondly, this agreement is potentially controversial, as it evidently has no legal force whatsoever, nor does it contain any safeguards regarding the respect for human rights. It is impossible to escape the impression that the Union is once again unconditionally financing an autocrat. Egypt is certainly a strategically extremely important country, also for Europe. But the Commission must cease such practices. We are aware of the challenges that Egypt is facing. And it is only right that Europe also helps its partners. But we must ask ourselves whether Europe is part of the solution or part of the problem. And at whose expense it concludes such agreements and who it might potentially harm. It would be unacceptable for Europe, without adequate safeguards, to contribute in any way to the violation of human rights and the suppression of democracy and the rule of law.

This is the value of the agreement between the European Union and Egypt, concluded in March at al-Sisi's court with Giorgia Meloni, accompanied by Ursula von der Leyen. A full 200 million will be used to halt migrant departures, further externalising the control of European borders and ignoring human rights. This agreement was not only signed bypassing the scrutiny of the European Parliament, but it completely ignores the grave rule of law situation in Egypt. Indeed, cooperation with this country cannot be separated from our demand for human rights to be respected, by guaranteeing freedom of expression, releasing arbitrarily detained persons, and ending the repression of minorities. This was reminded to us just in these days, here in the European Parliament, by the presence of Patrick Zaki, detained for months by the Egyptian regime and now finally free, who told us: \"If I am here, it is because you too, in these chambers, believed that fighting for my freedom was a battle to be won.\" Giulio Regeni's parents also ask this of us, he who died more than eight years ago in Egypt and for whom we are still seeking the truth. A truth that the Egyptian authorities continue to cover up and which the Italian government and European authorities should demand with much greater force. Indeed, yes, fighting for freedom and for truth is a battle to be won. And as Europe, we must continue to do so. Certainly, the European Parliament must prevent this type of commitment from being hampered by agreements lacking monitoring and transparency, carried out by governments in an utterly unacceptable manner.\n",

      "\tMr President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, I will start my intervention today by saying very clearly, the European Parliament must have guidelines for the next European budget, and our priorities are important and must be taken into consideration by the Commission and the EU Council. We have managed, after long discussions, to build a document that has clarity, that sets a vision for the upcoming EU budget and puts forward a clear direction for the negotiations that will take place between our institutions. I want to thank everyone involved and to reiterate my appreciation for the strong vote in favour of the report in the Budget Committee of the European Parliament. Our institution must show unity in saying that we need to allocate adequate financial resources for the priorities that are important to our EU citizens, for the development of our businesses, for a fair Europe that does not leave anyone behind. We need to support the creation of quality jobs while protecting our industry. We must help our farmers and continue to invest in our rural areas. We can develop our infrastructure while preserving the quality of our air and of our forests, at the same time as – this is important – protecting people against floods and droughts. For all of that, there are three key directions that need to be followed: using more effectively the funds that we have available; fighting against corruption; and focusing on the impact of our policies. We need to make full use of the unused funds from the previous financial period and allocate them to the beneficiaries and programmes that have a high absorption rate. We must allocate sufficient resources for our strategic priorities and for our new objectives. We need to make it happen. We can ensure adequate financial support for Erasmus students while investing in our economy. Finally, we need to keep the democratic control over the EU budget with a strong role of the European Parliament in order to deliver what people expect from us, by better including our social objectives in funding our programmes, or developing, for instance, the Civil Protection Mechanism.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tI am particularly pleased with the inclusion in our document of aspects that directly concern the area I represent, and I refer here to Romania. I refer to our call for supplementary funds for the full accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area. Entry by air and sea into the free movement area at the end of this month will be a success, and we wish to use this moment for a favorable decision for full accession by the end of the year. At the same time, I emphasize the importance of our request regarding support for the agricultural sector and rural environment. We must strengthen support programs for farmers, help young people working in agriculture, develop villages using European funds, and ensure that subsidies are distributed equitably and reach where they are needed. All European citizens must be treated fairly and must benefit from the same rights and opportunities. We have requested in the document the allocation of additional funds so that every citizen has access to state-of-the-art medical treatments and equipment. A strong Europe protects its citizens, and it is evident that only together can we ensure this. An important dimension of European action also consists in facilitating the mobility of European citizens. By improving the transfer of social rights and pensions, we are practically helping the European diaspora even more to return home. Finally, the European Parliament is firm in saying that we want a citizen-oriented budget that leads to an increase in the standard of living and the improvement of infrastructure in our cities and villages. The European Union must use funds as efficiently as possible, in order to increase the quality of medical and educational services, ensure that infrastructure becomes an engine of development, and facilitate the creation of well-paid jobs. We have tools available to do this, but it is important to use them appropriately. Our message to European citizens before the European Parliament elections must be that we can build the Europe we want: democratic, social, and sustainable.\n",

We have one of the strongest languages on border management and security ever mentioned in the European Parliament budgetary guidelines. If we do not keep the line, if we do not keep the compromises, we cannot ensure a better and more secure Europe. I am confident that we are not going to lean towards the far right, but also focus – and this is a priority on the common – on the common objectives that are explicitly mentioned in the text.\n",

But this first step is really done as a teamwork together with a very good – I think – result because the report is balanced. The result is also unique because not one amendment was tabled from the main political groups. We have a lot of amendments from the radical left, radical right, radical right wing, but I think generally they are out of scope. So if we will go this way, I feel that we will have the opportunity to work together after the elections to adopt the particular budget for the next year. This is a very important year because not only the first one after the elections, but also the year of the Polish Presidency, so I have in my heart also Polish priorities, and I have to say thank you, Victor, once more, that these priorities are also included. We have very tough times, so of course, security is number one, and we have a lot of wording on that, including even military mobility. This is something completely new. But I would like also to emphasise from my Polish experience, our Polish experience, very important paragraphs focused on the rule of law: without rule of law, democracy doesn’t exist. So the special programme dedicated to NGOs, citizens’ rights and values – I was the rapporteur of that – is also emphasised in this report, which is very important. Of course, many of the priorities are mentioned by Victor during his speech. I would like to, in the end, also say that we have to be very careful for the farmers’ expectations. We have to have in mind that the many expectations from the citizens we have to fight also with the high cost of energy. A lot of things are mentioned in the end.

It is not a mere exercise in debt management, of cutting here to stitch there. For this, we approved, in the revision of the multiannual budget, a dedicated instrument, the EU Recovery Instrument (EURI), the end of the tunnel of the so-called Cascade.

We can fund programmes to combat domestic violence, or to ensure that women do not lose out in the digital transition.

Therefore, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Victor Negrescu, for his work, for his sensitivity in accommodating all groups, and especially some of the Greens' priorities – concerning decarbonisation; concerning also the intelligent management of water resources, which is fundamental for a country like Portugal; on several matters where we very difficultly managed to reach an agreement; and also on the issue of external aid, and therefore everything involving the conflict occurring in Palestine, in Gaza. We thus managed to have a harmonised text. Unfortunately, once again – and let's hope this is not the case, as happened last year – this afternoon, in the vote, we might once again see these consensualised political guidelines rejected by some completely radicalised amendments from some MEPs who do not participate in the construction of these common lines and who are usually linked to very extreme political currents. Indeed, once again, I stress that the far-right is not here, shared nothing, did not work, is never at the negotiating table, and then submits amendments to literally blow up all the work that has been done.

Budgetarily, we are simply not ready for it. A paradigm shift in expenditure is necessary, a shift away from what I call 'subsidy mania' – covering everything with government-driven subsidies – towards actively stimulating the private sector, so that future-oriented investments are given every opportunity, without being stifled by governments and bureaucracy.

My first remark to Mr Halicki is that the absent far-right MEPs, not a single one of whom is present, have tabled some extreme amendments to destroy this consensus. Do not vote for them, you of the EPP, so that what was built by Mr Negrescu is not destroyed, as happened last year with Mr Lewandowski's report, who belongs to your political group, and which you undermined, because the majority of the EPP collaborated with the far-right, who want neither a strong budget nor a united democratic Europe. Therefore, you were right to rebuke the absent members, but do not side with them in the votes to upset the balance that has been achieved. My own political group acted constructively.

We must also never forget the times we are living in, and it is crucial that the budget provides the necessary means to support Ukraine. It is an investment we make in our own defence and our values. The European Union's strategic autonomy is also essential, and now that STEP has been approved, it is very important to move forward with this strengthening of our strategic autonomy. 2025 is also a crucial year, and it is extremely important that Member States do not lose a single cent of the resources at their disposal. It is concerning to observe the implementation of the recovery and resilience plans, to observe the implementation of cohesion policy funds, and to note that there are risks of losing these amounts. And regarding the recovery and resilience plan, it was essential that it be extended and that there be no limit to its implementation, which is the 2026 deadline.

I am convinced that our citizens, eager for security and freedom, will be very sympathetic to an extraordinary additional budgetary effort. To this end, our governments, mindful of the well-being of our citizens and aware of their responsibilities, should agree on the launch of a Eurobond whose mission would be to signal to Kyiv that our Union will not abandon the Ukrainians, and this would be in addition to the efforts already deployed in this regard to be able to meet our responsibilities.\n",

At this stage, the guidelines stage, a broad base of support for Parliament's budgetary priorities is essential, and this has been achieved, as it defines the negotiating position in interinstitutional agreements. This is thanks to the rapporteur Victor Negrescu, but also to the shadow rapporteurs, who ensured that a certain prevalence of social issues – understandable given Mr Negrescu's political affiliation – was balanced by considerations of competitiveness, innovation, and defence. This is therefore a good harbinger for the next steps of this rather routine procedure.\n",

I am actually very disappointed that the Member States consistently cut Horizon across the board – that is, science and research, what makes us more independent, what makes us stronger, what makes us better – that is being cut by the Member States. That is quite a frustrating process with which I do not agree. Secondly, we must indeed invest more money in defence, for our security and for our foreign policy. Because only through the European budget will we be able to ensure sufficient synergies and provide Ukraine with the support it needs. And also a word on UNRWA, the UN agency assisting Palestinian refugees: Of course, we need a UN relief agency that operates on the ground there. But frankly, to write into the guidelines that there are supposedly no indicators that would show that there has been abuse, is simply nonsense and untrue.

The agenda in Bulgaria, however, is different, because in recent days incidents involving refugees have increased, and with that, fear and dissatisfaction have also grown, which is the last thing we need. What we need is more money for border protection, more personnel at the borders, and more equipment to protect ourselves. I am proud that yesterday the leader of the largest party in Bulgaria, Mr. Borissov, submitted a bill that strengthens not just the Bulgarian border, but the eastern border of the European Union.

Likewise, major cities like Ludza, Krāslava or Dagda are located within the same proximity to the Russian border. Building walls or any other military or border control infrastructure will definitely increase security, but that comes at a cost. That will bring the level of investment in this region – the region of Latgale – basically down to zero. You cannot build walls, you cannot dig rows or put anti-tank defences and expect economic growth at the same time. It just doesn’t work that way. And that clearly means we need a stronger, proactive role of the European Union and its budget. EU money must be directed towards providing additional new support for both the regions, like Latgale, for economic and social development, to compensate the costs incurred by the war and the geopolitical situation.\n",

It is clearly impossible to have a sufficient budget to cover all points. However, we must clearly define priorities in order to have the greatest impact. As many of you have said, the situation of the European Union, and consequently our budget, is influenced by the conflicts taking place in our neighbourhood. It is not us who started the war in Ukraine, but if we do not help Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova, our lives will be forever changed and threatened by the barbaric attitude of Moscow's leaders. We are helping Moldovans and Ukrainians not only to save lives, but also to save our own lives. Therefore, we must continue to show the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia, and the countries of the Western Balkans that we are there to help them become members of the European Union. The situation is just as complicated in the Middle East, and, indeed, there is no easy solution. What is clear is that our report has tried to take all concerns into consideration in a consensual manner, in order to show that the European Union is present, without, however, turning into a foreign policy debate. Together, we have succeeded in showing that dialogue remains the best solution to give strength to our Parliament.

Poverty is, of course, exclusion from adequate financial resources, but it is much, much more. It is exclusion from education, it is exclusion from proper work, it is exclusion from necessary healthy diets, from health care, and it is exclusion from our societies and decision making. Combating poverty is extremely important, because poverty – understood in the larger context – is a violation against human rights. So yes, we do have a moral duty to work to implement the SDGs and to fight against poverty. But we do have a self-interest to do that also, because we cannot sustain civilised civilisation with increasing poverty and separation between different groups of people. We cannot solve environmental problems and we cannot implement Green Deal. We cannot build our societies with all the full intellectual capacity and the work capacity, what the people would have. Just to put it very boldly: we cannot build our human world and we cannot solve any of our problems without tackling poverty. And as you, Commissioner, said, yes, we do have the money, we hopefully do have the will and we do have the means and equal proportional taxation global wide and combating tax evasion is an important part of that.

And the European Union, as I said, must set an example on this path, both in its internal choices and options, and in the processes of cooperation or economic and political relaunch on an international scale.

People do not stop working, they have income to pay for their most basic expenses, they have the ability to plan their lives for the coming years, they have the ability to free themselves from slave labour and, therefore, this transfer of money is also a transfer of power to the citizens.

      "\tMr President, I think it’s slightly ironic that we’re having this discussion today, just over a week out from a referendum in Ireland that’s supposed to address inequality and discrimination, but that will actually just entrench both of them. The plan is to remove a discriminatory clause in our Constitution about women in the home to make women constitutional equals, but unfortunately it just replaces one discriminatory clause with one that’s just as discriminatory, one that will entrench inequalities just as much. Instead of misogynist language, we’ll have ableist language. We’ll get a constitutional provision that says care is the family’s problem, not society’s. The care amendment is useless and dangerous if what we want to do is to address inequality. Some of the most vulnerable people in Irish society, people who face the most entrenched inequalities, are asking us to say no. I think we should respect that.\n",

At the same time, almost 5 billion people worldwide have become poorer. In 2023, the risk of poverty in Portugal stood above 20%, even after social transfers were accounted for. Meanwhile, large corporations profit 25 million euros per day from the exploitation and impoverishment of workers. In addition to an increasingly unjust distribution of wealth, policies destroying public services, deregulating labour, and compressing wages exacerbate inequalities. Madam Commissioner, it is time for the political will to change policy and, effectively, confront the causes of inequality, combat unemployment and promote employment with rights, increase wages and pensions, regulate and reduce working hours, ensure universal, quality, and free public services, guarantee the right to education, and tax the profits of large economic groups.

This inequality is produced by various forces of global capitalism that divide, exclude and polarise the world. The emergence of neoliberalism has certainly exasperated the problem. Neoliberalism is a project of the ruling class to increase its power and profits on a global scale. Too often, the better off blame the poor for being poor, but the truth lies elsewhere. The developed North imposes conditions of exclusion on the Global South. We are rich because they are poor; 4.6 billion people in the world today are living on less than USD 5 a day. If they were better off, we wouldn’t have quite as much wealth. We are still robbing the Global South blind. Colonialism hasn’t stopped. Today it’s called financial imperialism and the developed North is playing a huge role in continuing the poverty of the Global South. (End of catch-the-eye procedure)\n",

      "\tMr President, Commissioner, distinguished colleagues! What is at stake with this advance passenger data? It is about the fact that all of us, when we travel, especially by air, provide data. Data about our name, our date of birth, and similar information, which is then passed on by the airlines to the authorities of the countries we wish to travel to. This is a perfectly normal procedure that exists all over the world. What we are currently discussing here in the European Parliament is: what rules are we actually setting for the processing of this data? Because, distinguished colleagues, for data processing we naturally need rules, because without rules there is no proper data protection.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tWhat the Commission has presented here is a standardisation of these datasets concerning the questions: which data can actually be passed on, how are they passed on, where are they processed, to use the modern term? And eu-LISA was chosen as the external agency for this. I think that's good, because I believe that eu-LISA is a good partner for us in this regard. But it also concerns the question of how other data, the so-called PNR data – how these data, which are partly the same as the API data – how these data flows can be initiated simultaneously.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tFor us as Parliament, it was particularly important that passengers travelling within the European Union could continue to do so without problems. Because there was a fear, or at least we feared, that with the collection of this data, which is to take place automatically, in the future queues would have to be anticipated at airports, or even processes that would prevent people from simply checking in online, then proceeding to boarding, flying to another country and experiencing borderless Europe as we like to experience it. Instead, we feared processes similar to those encountered when travelling to a country that is not part of the Schengen area, and we wanted to prevent that.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tWe have succeeded in this during this debate, because we now have a good compromise before us that also ensures that online boarding remains possible, and that was particularly important to us as Parliament. I would like to say at this point that we have found a good compromise that, for example, also excludes biometric data and ensures a high standard of data protection. And I would like to sincerely thank my co-rapporteur Assita Kanko – because there are two reports we are discussing here; I was responsible for one and Ms. Kanko was responsible for the other – and all shadow rapporteurs. Because that was good, productive work, always focused on the matter at hand. Above all, we succeeded in bringing together the ideas, so to speak, from the perspective of both the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in this House and the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and thus achieving a good result. That is why I am glad that we can conclude this in the current legislative period, and I would then ask for all your support for this report.\n",

      "\tMr President, thank you, colleague Oetjen. I would also like to thank my good colleague Jan-Christoph and all the shadow rapporteurs. I think we made a very effective negotiating team. We found compromises, first within the Parliament and then with the Council, in a very positive atmosphere. And we brought in a lot of good points for Parliament and, more importantly, for our European citizens. I believe that these regulations are going to prove very useful in the fight against terrorism and organised crime. At the moment, 27 Member States and hundreds of airlines use a wide range of separate systems to send passenger data to countries of destination. The passenger data are collected in a self-declaratory manner. Of course, the vast majority of travellers are of goodwill, but the bad guys find ways to abuse the system and travel in and out of the EU undetected. I think that with the solutions we found, we will make life more difficult for criminals and terrorists, but easier for travellers, air carriers and Member State authorities. Now, picking up from my colleague Jan-Christoph, the first point I wanted to mention here is the new Article 5a in API law enforcement on the selection of intra-EU flights. It was not in the Commission proposal, but we made a proposal in the Parliament mandate. The reason is that the European Court of Justice 2 years ago ruled that PNR data may be collected for internal EU flights and shared with law enforcement authorities, but strict limitations will have to apply. The text we have agreed stays fully within the Court ruling on the PNR Directive, whilst offering the Member States and the Commission concrete tools for the implementation of this ruling. I am glad that we could also agree the 12-month deadline for reviews of the assessment. With everything we put in place, we make sure that people’s privacy is protected. The second point worth highlighting here today is that we agreed to move towards mandatory use of the router for PNR data as well. From Parliament’s side, we believed from the start that this would be wise. Most importantly, it will improve privacy oversight. It can truly help with the implementation and supervision of the Court ruling on PNR. It can also lead to a streamlining that is beneficial for air carriers and Member States alike. I think that the phasing approach is the right one, and I would like to thank the Commission for the updated legislative financial statement, which shows the commitment to make the router work also for PNR data starting in 2028. Thirdly, I would like to mention a point that was a bit more difficult for Parliament, namely, what to do in case of technical impossibility to use the router. Throughout the negotiations, Parliament always wanted to stay very closely within the scope of the regulations and avoid any parallel systems. However, we do understand that, in some exceptional cases, Member State authorities may need to ask air carriers for API data via other means if the central system managed by eu-LISA is down. I am glad that the Council accepted our wish to add some extra safeguards, and I trust that with the triple backup of the system, these situations will in any case be extremely rare. Finally, from my side, I would also like to underline our flexibility in accepting the Council’s text on the governance structure. We believe it is a bit unusual to be so specific at the level of the main legislation. However, we also do understand the Council’s desire to give clarity and legal certainty about the various groups and bodies involved in preparing and monitoring the system. Let me take this opportunity to again thank my colleagues, rapporteur Oetjen and the shadows, including Jeroen Lenaers and Tineke Strik, who are present here, and I think we were able to step over all kinds of difficulties from time to time, and we can be proud of the agreement on these important regulations. Of course, I thank all the staff and especially my advisor, Jannes De Jong.\n",

      "\tMr President, this is the last late night debate of this mandate of the European Parliament. So it’s rather fitting that it is dedicated to such an important topic. And I would like to congratulate the co-rapporteurs Assita Kanko and Jan-Christoph Oetjen, for really bringing this important file to a very good and satisfying conclusion. Now, every year, over a billion passengers travel to, from or within the EU. And of course, this is good news because it means that Europe is and remains a very attractive place to be. But it obviously also comes with certain security implications. And we have a duty, all of us together, to make sure that Europe is as safe and secure as possible. We owe this to our citizens. And passenger information, especially when it’s combined with passenger name records, can really be useful to improve border controls, to reduce irregular migration, and to enhance our fight against serious crime and terrorism. And the existing API Directive has already really proven its value in this regard. But there were some elements that needed fixing. The uneven implementation in the Member States, and the fact that there was no mandatory collection of such data, meant that only 65% of incoming flights were actually checked in this way, making it fairly easy for those who wanted to avoid these checks to actually do so. This will no longer be possible. Everybody travelling to the EU will be subject to the same checks, and this is very important, just as it is important that we now can also use API data on intra-EU flights where this is relevant, in order to help our law enforcement authorities to do their job and keep us safe, and fully in line with the way we use PNR for the same data and in line with the Court of Justice ruling. Now, this is really an important element of the EU’s security strategy. It will close the loopholes that we see today and it will have a direct impact on the safety of us all. So I really look forward to its rapid implementation. And once again, thanks to the co-rapporteurs, to the Commission for the excellent proposal, which I agree, we actually managed to strengthen and improve in our negotiations and to all those involved, thank you very much.\n",

Still, the text improves the status quo with clear, harmonised European rules on API collection. We also set limits and safeguards. Where Member States now do whatever they want, this revision will shorten the data retention periods and create more safeguards. And finally, after all these years, we bring the collection of API and PNR data in line with the PNR judgment, with clarified selection criteria for intra-EU flights, additional privacy safeguards, and the prohibition of profiling and collecting biometric data. So although API data collection is now mandatory, which we regret, there are also much clearer limits and safeguards. So I would like to thank both rapporteurs, Ms Kanko and Mr Oetjen, for this result and for the good cooperation also with the Commission. And we can conclude this cooperation in the very last voting session of this term, so congratulations for that. Catch-the-eye procedure\n",

The concern of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in participating in this legislative procedure has been, as always, to maintain the European data protection standard, which is the highest in the world, so that the data complies with the principles of proportionality and necessity and its transmission is ensured by a centralised agency, eu-LISA, which guarantees legal compliance in such a sensitive area. The European Parliament, which today holds its last plenary session in this 2019-2024 legislature, has not stopped growing throughout the entire process of supranational integration and, therefore, one can only conclude that the European Parliament continues to grow.

But we cannot look away from the fact that we talk about having legal pathways for legal migrants and asylum seekers. But we have stopped the most effective, safest and modern ways of transport for these people, because we are asking the airlines to stop people that do not have a visa to come into the EU. And you do not get a visa if an embassy, an EU embassy, fears that you will seek asylum. So therefore, with the great work that has been done with adopting the asylum and migration package two weeks ago, we need to make sure that this system that we’ve adopted, which is an improvement on the existing system, does not hinder the protection of refugees across the world.

We have the Greens saying: Yes, we have concerns, but we are implementing the judgment of the European Court of Justice. And we are setting clear rules and strengthening data protection.

And that also shows how European policy can be made: by seeking consensus, incorporating the good points from the various political groups and forging a compromise that can then be supported by all. I believe that this is, in the best sense, what we do here in the European Parliament: we debate the issue, but then we find a result, forge a compromise, and implement it. And if the Member States – who are unfortunately not represented by the Council at this moment, but the Belgian Council Presidency has done a good job, that must also be said at this point – implement it quickly, then the matter will also be properly addressed.

      "\tMadam President, Madam Vice-President, dear Prime Minister, dear Petteri, first of all, thank you for addressing the European Parliament and as an EPP Group leader, I want to congratulate you for the trust you received from the Finnish people for being elected as Prime Minister and after your success, Alexander Stubb was elected as President of Finland. So it is in good safe EPP hands today, thanks to the trust of the Finnish people. Finland is a true EPP – European – success story, and also an EPP success story. The first country in Europe to introduce a universal election law for parliamentary elections in ‘96. In ‘97, when women had no voting rights in most of Europe, they were already 19 members in the Finnish Parliament – women, female members – in the Finnish Parliament. Since gaining independence in 1917, Finland has made an incredible journey: from being one of the poorest countries in Europe, it has become one of the most successful. And today, Finland is a European leader in gender equality, climate policy and innovation. Probably it has something to do with ‘sisu’, the special determination that defines the Finnish national character. And, dear Petteri, you and Kokoomus have definitely shown some special determination in always standing up for Finland’s accession to NATO. The Finnish Socialists and Greens changed their minds about joining NATO only after the invasion of Ukraine, while already in 2018, you were warning Europe, I quote: ‘The crisis in Ukraine, recent terrorist attacks and hybrid threats have shown that both the EU’s defence cooperation and NATO are needed and that they can complement each other.’ And that is really true EPP leadership. Finland makes both NATO and the European defence stronger. Not only do you bring the strongest artillery in Western Europe, an army capable of fighting in -40 degrees, but also the experience of guarding Europe’s longest border with Russia. Finns know what it means to have Russians as neighbours. Like the Ukrainians, you fought in cold trenches and frozen forests to stay free. The only difference is that you stood up to Stalin alone, whereas today we stand together against Putin. This means not only supporting Ukraine as long as this takes, but also stopping Putin’s hybrid warfare against the Finnish border, as you said. Finland also is currently building up a fence to protect our external border. We, as the EPP do what is necessary to do and, dear Petteri, the Finnish border is a European border, as you said. The Finnish border is NATO border. No dictator can use illegal migration as a weapon to blackmail us as Europeans. Standing together always means to build up also a competitive Europe. And when it comes to innovation, the Finns are hard to beat. Finland is today a world leader in digital infrastructure, the first country in Europe to build up a 5G network and it is already ready to implement 6G. Finland, Europe’s forest, has made innovation the basis of its climate policy. Companies are investing currently EUR 200 billion, 70 % of Finland’s GDP, in our green transition. Almost 1 in 3 Finnish employees works directly or indirectly in the tech sector. So you are proving that innovation is the way to more, to better quality jobs. And how do we do so? High quality education, investment and research and development for more than 3 % of GDP and cutting red tape. To become more innovative, Europe must become more like Finland. Dear Petteri, your leadership is making Europe stronger, safer and ready to face not only today’s challenges, but also tomorrow’s challenges. Thank you for being with us.\n",

The European people learned through great suffering that hate and fear are dangerous to democracy, a hate and fear that the far right has against those who they consider to be different, a hate and fear that are affecting the centre right within the European Union, where the far right has been allowed to be part of five national governments and hundreds of regional and municipal governments. Dear Members, Finland is another example of the regression and the decline represented by the alliance between the European People’s Party and the far right. Mr Orpo, do you believe that the best way to defend workers’ rights is to promote dismissals, undermine social dialogue and restrict the right to strike? Do you think that the best way to eradicate poverty and inequality is to reduce public spending on pensions, unemployment benefits, housing and parental allowances? Are you proud of your Finance Minister when she posts on social media with large scissors, expressing satisfaction at cutting people’s income and social security? Do you feel comfortable governing with a minister who declared himself a Nazi? And this person is still a minister. Mr Orpo, your alliance with the far right is the real threat to our democracy and to the European project. This is why the future of the European Union is at stake. And the question that we must ask our citizens is clear. What kind of Europe do we want? A Europe hostage to climate change denial or a Europe committed to fight against it and that makes the green transition an opportunity to create wealth? A Europe that undermines the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women or a Europe that defends the feminist cause and the achievements of women? A Europe of the elites or a Europe that protects workers in the face of the challenges posed by artificial intelligence and protects families in time of crisis, as we did during the pandemic on the war? Dear Members, in times of uncertainty and great transformation, it is not enough to simply try to resist the reactionary wave. We have to move forward. We need a European project that makes citizens proud again to be European, a project that is not guided by the fear, hate and pessimism of the right and the far right. Mr Orpo, Mr Weber, put an end to your alliance with those who want to destroy Europe. Let us continue building a Union that will be a beacon to inspire the world through its example of integration and progress; a Union with more democracy and more equality; a Union that makes the social pillar a reality with decent jobs and affordable housing; a Union that is more united and also more open; a Union at the forefront of the fight against climate change, committed to human rights, and that places people at the centre of the digital transformation. Mr Orpo, Mr Weber, your only enemy is the far right. In the last century, your political family made a mistake by opening the door to the far right, and Europe and the world paid a high price.

A border which, as you reminded us, was the scene of a hybrid war last winter, with Vladimir Putin's instrumentalisation of migrants. With the arrival of spring, it is highly likely that this will soon be the case again. This is unacceptable, and the European Union must continue to provide the necessary support, as it has already begun to do by mobilising Frontex agents.

It is not NATO that expands of its own accord; it is sovereign states that democratically choose to apply to join our alliance. Not the other way around. If new states wish to join NATO, it is obviously not by chance.

      "\tMadam President, dear Prime Minister, welcome to the European Parliament. It is pleasure to have you here. As a leader of the Greens, you can imagine that I was expecting what you would say on the climate. I had to wait for a while in your speech to get to that point, and the first thing that struck me is that there was a lot in your speech about competitiveness, at the beginning, and then some stuff on the climate, and you don’t make the link. But this is the only game in town for Europe. If we do not lead this transition, China and the US will. So it is a matter of economic survival for Europe. It is not a detail of something that we can leave for later. Second: details. You say that we focussed on details. Setting ourselves the goal of climate neutrality – a detail? Regulations to reduce emissions in transport, in buildings, in energy – details? Absolutely not! What we did is focus on the bare essentials. There’s one point I agree with you on, which is that no, you cannot achieve everything through regulation. There I totally agree. But regulation sets ourselves targets and creates markets. So we need regulation. You cannot say okay, we should dispense with it. You didn’t say that, but you cannot at the same time say we need more carrots, but then we don’t want to spend money on it. I mean, what are the carrots if it is not public money? There again I see really a contradiction in doing it. If we don’t want to do it through regulation, it is going to be subsidies. That’s what the US are doing. That’s what’s China is doing. They do not do anything on regulation; they do everything on subsidies. We have a more balanced approach where we have both regulation – say ‘sticks’ – and subsidies, and that’s ‘carrots’. But if you say we need less regulation and we want less state aid, and at the same time you say we want more climate action, then something is wrong. It doesn’t work. You can’t have all this. Every study that looks at investment says we need between 2% and 2.5% of GDP extra on investment if we want to reach our climate targets. Of this, most agree that at least half should be public investment. There is no way around this. So this is a moment where we need to step up the public investment. Again, I would call on you to support these investments locally and at the European level rather than oppose them. Finally, Prime Minister, you know, I disagree with Manfred Weber on a lot of things. I disagree with Valérie Hayer on a lot of things. I disagree with Iratxe García on a lot of things, and with the far left as well. But at least we have a common base. We have a common base, and that is that human dignity is indivisible. None of us says that some human beings are inferior or implies this. And this is where I believe that people like us should never, never go into alliance with people who de facto consider some human beings as inferior. That’s what you did in Finland. I’m glad, Manfred, that your colleagues in Portugal are not going to do that.\n",

First and foremost, the importance of Finland's accession to NATO for Northern and Eastern Europe, and how crucial it is for Estonia, cannot be overstated. Finland has built its defence capabilities for decades, and successfully so, as Finland's defence capability is one of the best in Europe. As an Estonian, I have a clear understanding that Finland has followed the principle of \"fewer words, more action.\" Other European countries, including Estonia, should do the same. Now that Estonia and Finland are allies in NATO, this further strengthens the cooperation between our countries. We know well from history that our common neighbour, Russia, always awaits the moment when its border neighbours are weak and have forgotten Russia's true nature. But for both Estonia and Finland to be strong, cooperation is needed, cooperation also within the European Union, because many European countries may not adequately understand the concerns important to us in our countries. For example, the so-called green transition: sufficient energy supply, for instance, is vital for both Estonia and Finland, but it cannot be guaranteed solely by wind or solar power, as that is technically impossible, not to mention the enormous sums that green enthusiasts are prepared to squander for this purpose, which will weaken the livelihoods of our residents. Europe should move towards realistic climate and energy policies and forget green utopias. This also applies to immigration policy. Although Finland's population is almost five times larger than Estonia's, we are still small countries in both a European and global sense. Immigration from the Middle East and Africa threatens our national existence. We cannot forget that our neighbouring country, Russia, has also used immigration as a tool in hybrid attacks on our borders. Another problem is the European Union's pressure to implement a common migration policy, which clearly makes it more difficult for our countries to manage immigration. Therefore, I hope for even greater cooperation between Finland and Estonia, because our concerns in a tumultuous world are very similar. And for the final statement, don’t very much listen about the Socialists and Greens because they haven’t really heard about democracy, that there are elections, and the people are giving the voice which kind of government they would like to have. That’s why good luck and keep on the same track.\n",

      "\tMadam President, dear Mr Orpo, normally I would be happy and proud to welcome a prime minister from another Nordic country here in the European Parliament, but sadly I have to say today I’m not. Instead, I am disappointed, sad and honestly angry to have to welcome a Nordic prime minister that is leading a charge against social and trade union rights in his own country. Mr Prime Minister, the topic today is ‘This is Europe’, and I have one thing to tell you: the Europe you represent, Mr Orpo, is not the Europe I want. And more importantly, it is definitely not the Europe citizens need. What you are doing is clearly wrong because you are undermining what makes a Nordic welfare state strong. Your government makes it easier to fire people, and at the same time you want to cut social welfare and protection. This will harm workers and their families. Yet sadly it doesn’t stop here. At the same time, you try to undermine the Finnish system of collective bargaining – a collective bargaining system we, on a European level, aim to increase, you are actively trying to suppress. I’m sad to say so, but that is shameful. As if this was not enough, you also want to limit the freedom of people to go on strike and protest your policies. But Prime Minister, when Finnish people protest you in the street, the solution is not to take away the possibility to strike. Instead you should stop, reflect and listen. Mr Orpo, the Europe you represent is clearly a Europe for the few; a Europe that does not take care of your citizens, of our citizens and the planet. Instead, it runs away from responsibility. Sadly, we have seen it before. Whenever the right governs with the far right, the picture is the same. Those that claim to speak for the common man quickly betray him. Those that say they have the ordinary worker’s interests and concerns at heart quickly and brutally betray her. And that is exactly what is happening in Finland. That is exactly what we are seeing right now. And that is the reason that people are protesting you and your government, Mr Prime Minister. Dear Mr Orpo, this is Europe, and what you provide is definitely not the Europe we want. Mr Orpo, this is Europe. It should be a Europe for the many, not just a Europe for the wealthy few.\n",

We need a Union of preparedness, based on a broad understanding of security – whether it concerns combating pandemics, the sufficiency of medicines, the sufficiency and quality of food, adequate efforts to combat climate change that is bearing down on us and raising the level of ambition, or readiness for military uncertainties or other types of attacks around us. We need a broad understanding of security that also includes, as you said, social security. Because as democracy erodes and extremist movements rise, our capacity to act also becomes paralysed, and that could in fact be the worst threat that could befall us. We must have the ability to turn problems into challenges and challenges into opportunities, and that is precisely what the Investment Union is: how we transform our economy and industry to be green, competitive, utilising information technology, and productive of long-term sustainability, both socially and economically.

      "\tMadam President, Mr. Prime Minister, fair internal markets are a key pillar of the EU. They are particularly important for an export-driven country, such as Finland. Fairness means that companies genuinely compete in the single market and the most competitive ones win. This guarantees the productivity and growth of the entire EU. The derogations from state aid rules granted by the Commission since autumn 2020, amounting to four trillion euros, violate this principle. The use of billions, sometimes for the acquisition of large companies in one's own country, sometimes, for example, for supporting fossil energy – all of this is wrong. Thank you, Prime Minister Orpo, for condemning this. That is how I understood it. The EU's economic development is dismal. As the amount of labour input, a factor of growth, is barely increasing in the EU, a major leap must now be taken to improve productivity. This requires funding. I was once involved in making the famous decision that the EU should achieve a three per cent level in research and innovation funding by 2020. We have failed miserably in this. However, in the EU, funds totalling approximately one trillion euros are being used for regional and recovery aid over a few years. These funds must be given a new direction: towards supporting research, innovation, and key technologies. And that is quite different from state aid that erodes the single market. Putin's cruel war is a great humanitarian catastrophe, but it is also a significant material loss for Russia's and Belarus' neighbours. The EU's Interreg programme is well-suited to support cooperation among friendly border neighbours. Now, Russia is not friendly, and Interreg does not help the regions on the EU's eastern border. The EU therefore now needs a new external border programme. The need for such a programme is vastly greater and more justified than the 5 billion euro support given to external border neighbours due to Brexit. Sustainable use of forests is an important part of ensuring the EU's strategic autonomy and security of supply. Nothing other than wood can replace non-renewable raw materials.\n",

He says, for example, that he wants to build on the Nordic labour model in Finland, when his actions are actually dismantling it.

We have a patriotic government, which is doing its utmost to rectify the catastrophic legacy and immense debt burden left by the previous socialist government, which cannot be managed by constantly taking on more and more new debt and continuing reckless economic policies. Last autumn, Russia initiated a hybrid operation at the Finnish border, using migrants as a weapon. The Finnish government acted very decisively in this matter by closing the entire eastern border. Russia, which is waging a brutal war of aggression for the third year, is extremely unpredictable. We must be prepared for all possible scenarios. Border crossings by illegal immigrants must be prevented, by force if necessary. It must be remembered that Finnish border guards secure the entire common external border of the EU. Support for Ukraine must be continued and further strengthened. Ukraine must win this war, and it is our duty to do everything we can to achieve this goal. Responsible economic management is important throughout the EU and in all its Member States. One cannot live beyond one's means. For the first time in its history, Finland did not support granting discharge to the European Commission, for which I commend it. Behind this decision were the alarming findings of the European Court of Auditors regarding material and widespread errors in the management of the EU budget expenditure. The competitiveness of the European economy must be safeguarded. It is essential that the Finnish economy is put back on track.

Energy prices indeed remain one of the greatest handicaps for our continent, especially compared to Asia and the United States. Since 2022, the surge in energy prices has hit hard our bakers, our farmers, our industries, who are paying for two years of inaction to resolve this absolute emergency. A model's relevance is judged by its resilience. However, we must face the failure of this European energy price-setting mechanism, which has failed to protect people and businesses from an explosion of tariffs. It has amplified this, spreading the shockwave to all components of our economy, from industry to agriculture, as well as to families and our bakers. In two years, the European Union has not been able to reform this European electricity market. Unlike some, I do not resign myself to this great industrial exodus. While France has the historic asset of nuclear power, it must regain its energy sovereignty within a Europe that finally invests collectively in this abundant, cheap, and decarbonised energy.

We all want pensions, minimum wages, all to be safeguarded and secured. In this respect, we will have to invest in research, innovation, digitisation, free trade, complete the single market, create a framework which the private sector feels comfortable to invest in.

      "\tMadam President, ladies and gentlemen! My colleague rightly criticised that this must not be a budget like any other – that it must make a noticeable difference. If we look at Heading 7, a quick review might quickly give the impression that it could be a budget like any other. But I want to remind you that already at the beginning of this procedure, as the Committee on Budgets, we cut a sum from our Bureau's draft budget that, at 33 million, was larger than ever before. We in this House are therefore well aware that we have a lot to do and that in these difficult times, Parliament and all institutions must lead the way. However, I also believe that on 24 February, hardly anyone would have disagreed if we had said that we must strengthen our resilience here, that we must be prepared to defend ourselves against hybrid warfare, that we must make cybersecurity a real priority. Ladies and gentlemen, we really must do that. This is the only real priority that we are setting in terms of personnel in this budget: cybersecurity. I am pleased that we stand united across party lines on this and will implement it. I would also add: I thank you for the constructive atmosphere – also the Council Presidency – because I know that we are all in the same boat here. With CERT-EU, we already have an instrument that coordinates, that can lead the way, and that we can strengthen. I am very confident that we as Parliament, together – if there is a constructive will – will find a common path in the negotiations here to find a good solution for the benefit of all institutions. But – I must also say – it is not an option for us not to act here and simply let the risks remain risks. We must be prepared to defend ourselves. We must strengthen our resilience, my dear friends. The other institutions are also counting on us. Of course, it is our role as Parliament to strengthen the other institutions as well. I mention here the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors. For precisely at a time – and we as Parliament should state this with confidence – when the Community method is increasingly being pushed to the sidelines and intergovernmental action is being taken, we also need control instruments. Especially when Article 122 is always at the centre of action, we must strengthen the institutions that genuinely exercise control here, such as the Court of Auditors. Here too, as Parliament, we should not allow ourselves to be divided and clearly state the opinion: when 800 billion euros are at stake, then a few positions at this point are really not the wrong investment. There is enough to control, especially with this sum. I am of the opinion that, unlike in previous years, we should of course not participate in these petty rivalries between institutions. The situation is too serious for that. We have many major tasks, and I also see my task in my area as ensuring that the broad lines, which my colleague Mr. Ştefănuță has just described, do not recede into the background, and that we do not exhaust ourselves in detailed discussions between the institutions, but rather find solutions together that are truly appropriate to this budgetary situation – and I ask all those involved to do so. We are supposed to be thrifty, ladies and gentlemen, and therefore I am now giving this esteemed House 57 seconds as a sign that we can hopefully achieve good results in the negotiations.\n",

To be honest with ourselves, we need – not just for foreign policy – a new financial outlook to be able to meet the tasks we genuinely have to address. This, of course, immediately includes comprehensive aid for Ukraine, and indeed for this entire region, where all budget lines are strained to the utmost. Therefore, we can only work towards ensuring that what is most urgently needed – and this includes what we can do for Ukraine – is done with the limited resources we have.

As Chair of the Employment Committee, I wanted us to be more ambitious when it comes to the European Social Fund Plus, which is a key driver for strengthening the social dimension, investing in people and promoting employment. I wanted to see it in 2023, the European Parliament making the political call for the investment in children and young people by supporting additional allocation to Child Guarantee, by supporting the social dialogue. Not all these requests have been, right now, put together, but I still believe that this is important for the European Parliament. I hope that in the context of the revision of the MFF, we can keep our ambitions and ask for more resources to invest in people and mitigate the increasing inequality, documented, evidence—based, support the implementation of the European Care Strategy and promote the upskilling and reskilling by allocating more resources to the European Year of Skills. We need to put the resources in what we have been right now deciding to have in 2023. We need to have a strong call for increased flexibility and sufficient resources to respond to major crisis and accelerate the process of programming so that in 2023 we start finally, in all Member States, the implementation of 2021–2027 MFF funding. We need the Member States to spend all available resources for people. We cannot afford to waste more time in not spending the money that we have, for the well—being of our citizens.

If you look a little bit closer, it is just 7% of the budget, but you impose 40% of the cuts. I mean, if you give a madman a nail and you puncture the Horizon budget, you come up with your proposal.

The opinion of the Internal Market Committee is, as always, relatively balanced, because to a certain extent, we earn the money that the Member States and the Commission spend. Therefore, it was not a major problem to agree on this opinion here, but I would like to specifically highlight two issues that are of particular importance to the colleagues of the Internal Market Committee. We know that in the budgetary procedure, as parliamentarians, we defend our budget, the Commission defends its budget, and the Council tries to pay as little as possible. We respect that. However, with the legislation on the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, it is about creating a new regulatory entity across Europe, which will collectively not only enable us to better enforce the principle of the social market economy, but also generate revenue for the Commission and assume responsibilities from the Member States. Therefore, we collectively advocate – and as rapporteur for the Internal Market Committee, I am only one of many – for providing the European Commission with new staff in the area where it assumes responsibilities from the Member States, staff that is no longer needed by the Member States. At this point, the Parliament only has regulatory interests and, to some extent, supports the idea of the European Commission. We know that it is not entirely simple in the budgetary procedure, which is why I would like to sincerely thank colleagues Niclas Herbst and Mr. Lewandowski, who are dealing with this procedure, for their support, and I hope that we will address this issue thoroughly.\n",

The money must reach the people who are paying the energy bills, record inflation, drought, and the consequences of the pandemic and Putin's war. Transport, tourism, the labor market – all these are borne by citizens, especially if national governments and the European Union treat them too bureaucratically, inconsistently, insufficiently, and belatedly. These have been difficult years for all of us, but I don't know why it is that some pay more. Lorry drivers, teachers, medical staff, pensioners in particular, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, farmers, and all vulnerable categories. We have a duty to support them more, and in my Committees, for budget, transport, and tourism, I managed to secure funding for safe parking facilities and better public transport. The European Public Prosecutor's Office, led by Laura Codruța Kövesi, and all European institutions that stop criminals, must receive the requested budget. Their results are quickly visible, and European funds are recovered. The 2023 budget respects this line, and it is good that it does so. Member States are wealthy, and the Union has money for all of us to live better, but we must stop corruption and all the crimes that are bleeding us dry, including environmental crimes, from illegal logging to waste trafficking. Likewise, those who attack us from outside or from within, all must pay. Violations of the rule of law, non-compliance with sanctions imposed on Russia – we can no longer tolerate them.

Fisheries need deep reforms and investments. This investment fund must indeed be structuring for a sector with a profound need for renewal, because we are not talking here about a sector that merely needs economic vitality and to regain its momentum.

The FEMM Committee delivered a strong opinion, and I am glad that some crucial elements are reflected in the Parliament’s overall amendments in the budgetary resolution. First of all, the proposed increase of the Daphne Strand by EUR 2 million above the draft budget is a clear acknowledgement of the importance of tackling the alarming problem of gender based violence. Although this is considerably less than our Committee would have liked to see, it is a crucial signal to increase the funding for the Daphne Strand. Secondly, the very good wording regarding the Commission’s efforts for a methodology to measure the gender impact of the Union’s funding. The budgetary resolution includes concrete demands on measures, on scope and on gender disaggregated data. This type of scrutiny is very important, and Parliament’s strong stance on the EU4 Health programme and the inclusion of our Committee’s perspective that universal health coverage across the Union needs to include quality access to sexual and reproductive health and rights is necessary to involve. Lastly, specific support for equality for civil society organisations defending women’s rights and the rights of the LGBTIQ community under heading six ‘Neighbourhood and the World’ is very important, and I would like to stress that this will be crucial to defend in the upcoming negotiations.

The Parliament's position responds to these extraordinary circumstances, because when, if not now, should we tap into all possibilities of the European budget, not just the modest margins, but also, for example, these commitments?

      "\tMadam President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, the European Union is facing unprecedented challenges and a series of crises that directly affect citizens. The effect of the pandemic and of the war in Ukraine have led to rising inflation, rising energy prices and falling purchasing power across Europe. In this context, we must identify together the best solutions and endow our Union with the appropriate means to respond to citizens’ pressing needs. The Socialists and Democrats Group requested that the 2023 European budget uses all financial and technical means available to protect citizens and SMEs from the effects of this crisis, offering the Union real prospects for development. Our political group has pushed for increased resources of around EUR 300 million on energy—related measures, including research, investment and the development of green energy, designed to protect citizens against increased energy prices. In the same line, we propose the allocation of additional financial resources of EUR 60 million for SMEs by supplementing the specific related programmes but also by supporting the recovery of the cultural and creative sectors affected by the pandemic. Increased attention has also been given to health by increasing by EUR 150 million the actions aimed, for example, at providing solutions for the long—term effects generated by COVID. To these extremely important issues we added concrete actions related to the war in Ukraine: the support of States on the front line, such as Romania and Poland, and refugees, especially young people and minors from the conflict areas. The increase of EUR 250 million in humanitarian aid funds, the addition of funds for the Eastern and Southern Neighbourhoods, including the Republic of Moldova, and the allocation of an additional EUR 100 million for Member States to assist them in receiving migrants, will allow us to better manage the effects of the war. An important aspect is the increase in funds for the management of the external borders of the Union and the fact that, once again, at the request of the S&D Group, the European Parliament calls for and includes additional amounts for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen Area. To this measure is added an increase of EUR 210 million for the Erasmus+ programme, both for the access to education of young Ukrainians and for the continuation of mobility and educational programmes affected by the increase in living costs. I am particularly happy that the pilot project that I have proposed together with Vice—President Kaili will allow us the monitoring of children coming from Ukraine in such a way as to prevent human trafficking and ensure a safe future. I also welcome the inclusion of a reference in our resolution by which the Commission is invited to identify solutions for saving the unspent funds from the previous financial period and allocating these resources to the frontline countries affected by the war in Ukraine. In these uncertain times of our workers, it is also of paramount importance to continue supporting social dialogue and workers’ training and ensuring a stable funding for those initiatives. Everyone is feeling the effect of the current crisis and the European programmes are seriously affected by the galloping inflation. That is why we call for the review of the multiannual financial framework in order to build an ambitious and flexible budget that provides concrete and common answers to the challenges we face in such a way no one is left behind.\n",

I say \"once again\" because 2021 and 2022 were already exceptional in dealing with the health crisis. Europe, dear colleagues, has proven capable of rising to the challenge. But to rise to the challenge, we must provide ourselves with the necessary means. This is what we did with the joint procurement of vaccines and the implementation of a European COVID certificate. This is also what we did with the adoption of an exceptional recovery plan and the principle of common debt. By being more united and ensuring better coordination among Member States, we are stronger together. Numerous challenges await us, and our citizens expect us to address them at the European level. However, as you know, dear colleagues, Commissioner, we are reaching the limits of the multiannual financial framework just three years after its adoption. Inflation and rising energy prices are impacting all budgets, particularly those of our institutions and agencies. These are the entities that make the European Union function. We must be exemplary in managing this budget without, however, hindering their operations in service of the citizens. I would like to thank my colleague Nicolae Ştefănuță, who, together with the different groups, managed to find a compromise and propose an ambitious and necessary budget, setting priorities to address the major challenges ahead. The European budget is the keystone of our Union. It is essential for its proper functioning. Without it, the policies and reforms we vote on here will have no chance of succeeding. Without it, for example, and this is crucial, the implementation of the \"Fit for 55\" package and the Green Deal would be nothing but a utopia. This budget is what allows us to rise to the challenge. We must do so in the face of rising populism in Europe, which makes Europe a scapegoat. We must also protect this budget against those who use it for their own purposes, without respecting the fundamental principles of the rule of law, which are the essential foundations of European construction. For this, we have the rule of law conditionality mechanism, and we must not be afraid, dear colleagues, to use it.

We live in times of urgency. We have to tackle the climate catastrophe that we are on. We have to address war in our borders. We have to prepare for possible humanitarian crisis. And we need to mitigate the huge impacts that energy prices and overall high inflation will have on our citizens’ life. The EU budget is the most powerful tool that we as a Union have to try to influence also the rest of the world into doing what needs to be done. Although we understand the special circumstances that led to the timing of this year’s amending letter by the Commission, it does not employ the best practices and it influences the European Parliament’s ability to fulfil properly its role as a budgetary authority. We would hope that this doesn’t repeat itself. Let me address just three main issues on this amending letter. First, we will welcome the humanitarian aid increase, although it is still not as sufficient as we think. With the escalation of Russian attacks on civil targets in Ukraine, we have to expect further increases on humanitarian needs next year. Unfortunately, this goes also for humanitarian needs regarding climate change. In the amending letter, it is stated that further reinforcements in the course of 2023 are likely to be needed in the EU, so it has to sustain its 2022 humanitarian assistance and support the sharp increase of number of people in need. So we would like to question why this proposal was not made now, and will this be a proposal on the negotiations? Secondly, it is a positive sign that we see a reinforcement of the Union civil protection mechanism. To be able to react to more severe impacts on climate change, although there should also be increases in the parts of the budget that invest on fighting climate change and speed up our efforts. In this regard, the EU budgets is the best way to do that. Finally, on the issue of the European Union recovery instruments: the reinforcement of EURI of 450 million is extremely large. The European Parliament has warned repeatedly that having the EURI line in heading 2b is unsustainable, and that the NextGenerationEU interest costs and repayments should be counted over and above MFF ceilings. Will the Commission ever make this proposal? How is it planning to deal with the situation? And also finalising the position on the Council for us is quite disappointing in conditions that we are living in. The Council calls for prudence in its approach, but for us it is quite questionable and disappointing. We need more ambition for next year’s budget, not blunt cuts. And overall we believe that the European Parliament has presented a realistic and powerful proposal and with the rapporteur, Ms Ştefănuță, and all my shadow colleagues, I think we can push for a 2023 budget that properly reflects our priorities, our visions and our citizens’ needs.\n",

The draft resolution, dutifully, lists dozens or many problems in paragraph 2, but the proposed solutions simply do not correspond to these problems. Instead of providing relief to the EU – to EU citizens – the draft acts as a continuation of the EU’s current backward-looking policies. Almost all countries in the EU are confronted with soaring inflation, which is destroying our industries and plunging so many people into poverty, misery, and partly even suicide. We are faced with energy costs that many citizens truly can no longer afford. The day before yesterday, one of my sons told me that he now has to spend well over half of his teacher's salary on housing costs. That's absurd! Furthermore, many food prices have doubled. But what is happening to salaries? Unless you happen to work in an EU authority, salaries currently remain the same. So, how is the EU helping our desperate citizens? Is it ending the energy crisis? Is it ending the war? Is it stopping the climate change madness? No, unfortunately not. The present budget draft provides an endless flow of money to Ukraine, Green Deal policies, and a lot of woke nonsense. Apparently, we find it more important to sanction Russia to our own detriment and finance a deadly war in Ukraine than to ensure that our hardworking citizens and our families can pay their electricity bills and buy their food. Just for the statistics: The word \"gender\" is mentioned 98 times, Ukraine 92 times, climate 74 times. The word \"family,\" the backbone of the Union, does not appear even once. To make matters worse, the draft promotes militarism and Russophobia. Once pacifist left-wing parties, even here in this House, reject diplomacy, peace, and neutrality, and are degrading our Union into a military union. Distinguished colleagues, let me not be misunderstood; there are many good approaches in the draft that I can support, and indeed, I have submitted 300 amendments.

Unfortunately, the European Commission's amending letter published on 5 October does not show increased aid for Member States hosting refugees. I regret this. Poland and other countries still host these refugees, refugees from Ukraine. The escalation of hostilities in Ukraine suggests that further humanitarian support will soon be necessary, regardless of how many resources are available under the Solidarity and Emergency Aid Reserve. We also welcome the deletion of the so-called flexibility instrument in Heading 7, because when there is a war, it is not the time to discuss administration. The budget documents accurately reflect the situation in the European Union, as they show that we are dealing with inflation, with 'Putin-flation', we are dealing with the Russian aggressor, we are dealing with rising energy and food prices, that the quality of life will fall, that all the debts the Union has incurred will somehow have to be repaid, and thus we must seek fresh money, seek new money.

That’s because their parents have to make a choice between paying their heating bills and paying for their children’s food. It’s a hard choice, actually. At the same time, this House keeps moving forward with the plans to tear down the iconic European Parliament Spaak building in Brussels, because it’s 30 years old and is not energy efficient enough. Erecting new premises is already estimated to cost at least EUR 500 million. Taking into account skyrocketing prices, we can easily imagine that the final cost will be around EUR 1 billion. With EUR 1 billion, you can actually heat the Spaak building for roughly one century, irrespective of the level of energy efficiency in this building. My country, Latvia, recently celebrated the arrival of the first Next Generation EU payment – EUR 200 million. It’s roughly 20% of the price of one planned new European Parliament building – one of many EP buildings. The European Union budget is not only about money and lines; it’s about values.

Because it would be a mistake not to already prepare for the future during a crisis. We have just heard a major speech here from the AfD, the ID Group. It claimed that these were all the wrong priorities and that citizens would not be helped at all. We just heard that here. That is why I want to look – because we do this far too little – at what exactly was proposed by the ID Group? I can tell you this: to cut the entire funding for the European Public Prosecutor's Office – without justification. The European Public Prosecutor's Office, in its first seven months of operation alone, identified 5.7 billion euros in damages to the EU budget and the budgets of the Member States. 576 investigations in just seven months. You don't want that, you want to cut it, eliminate it. You are not concerned with the taxpayers' money of ordinary citizens. You are not concerned with helping citizens. You are still playing your games. We can see that too. After all, you are tabling these motions. That is ridiculous.\n",

I would also like to tell the colleague from the AfD, who didn't have enough time to listen for a few more minutes, that it is not the EU that is financing the war. And it is also not the EU that is driving up energy prices, which are currently causing sleepless nights for our citizens. It is Vladimir Putin who, with his criminal war of aggression against Ukraine, triggered this entire crisis. And I want to say this to the colleague who belongs to a party whose youth organisation allied itself with the youth organisation of Putin's party in 2016. To come here and give such speeches, that is simply outrageous! Putin's brutal attack is not only an attack on the territorial integrity of Ukraine, but an attack on our democratic and free way of life and on a rules-based global order. It shows that democracies are peaceful and autocracies start wars. And that is why it is so important that we express our maximum solidarity with Ukraine here, also with this budget, and of course also support the countries within and outside Europe that are particularly suffering from the consequences. And that is why, with this budget, we are also financing the AMIF programme for countries that take in refugees, and we have topped it up, as well as, of course, funds for humanitarian aid. However, the crimes in Ukraine must not make us forget that the greatest crisis of our planet is relentlessly advancing, and that is the climate and biodiversity crisis. The floods in Pakistan, but also the drought in Europe, have shown what serious effects this crisis already has on people today, how quickly entire systems can collapse. One only has to think of the nuclear power plants in France, some of which can no longer be cooled due to a lack of water. And that is why it is good that we are increasing funds here for the transition to clean energy, for the circular economy, for climate change mitigation, and also for the LIFE programme and biodiversity. Because when it comes to preserving biodiversity, it's not about the survival of a single beautiful butterfly. It is about safeguarding the economic foundations for future generations. For this, we must set the course here in Europe. We should be doing even more, but this is already heading in exactly the right direction.\n",

Unfortunately, this does not reflect the reality of the situation. In recent days, in particular, the affair concerning the European Union Agency for Asylum has returned to the headlines. The current Director, Nina Gregori, appointed only three years ago to restore the Agency's credibility following the abrupt resignation of her predecessor, who was accused of maladministration and harassment of staff, has in turn become the focus of a new investigation with accusations of nepotism, financial mismanagement, and the cover-up of internal complaints. Last January, the Agency received a new name and a strengthened mandate to help unify the way Member States handle asylum applications, but just three years after the previous scandal, history seems to be repeating itself with a new OLAF investigation against Director Gregori. Cases like this, involving an EU Agency with more than 2,000 employees that regularly ends up in tabloids and newspapers for the scandals it is embroiled in rather than for its work, undermine citizens' trust in European institutions, and, frankly, Madam President, I find this mismanagement of our taxpayers' funds during the toughest economic crisis since the Second World War to be irreconcilable.\n",

Surely we would be better off if, instead of increasing spending on migration control by 13%, those resources were allocated to strengthening public services, employment, and dignified reception at points of arrival, to fighting climate change, to deploying a social shield against the energy crisis, or to promoting peace.

This is valid at local level, at national level, and also at European level. The budget of the European Union should be a budget for investments, for cohesion, for making our economy more modern, cleaner, greener, more digital, and also for financing our traditional priorities: farmers, rural development and cohesion amongst European areas. This is the primary scope of the budget. However, unforeseen developments always occur. Since the beginning of this multiannual financial framework, we had to cope with the COVID pandemic, with the economic and social consequences generated by this pandemic, and now with the war in Ukraine, which means we have to help many host communities which have received hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees. We have to invest in reducing our dependency on Russian fossil fuels, in improving our efficiency, and we have to invest in renewables more and faster than we thought. The budget should never become just a budget of crisis, just a budget to react to unpredictable crises. It should still be allowed to finance investments. This is why the budget needs to be enough in terms of volume. This is also why, together as the Commission, as Parliament and as the Council, we will need to work on the revision of the multiannual financial framework, so that it can fund what we planned to fund before the crisis, but can also give answers to the people during times of crisis – because people expect us to react.

Even in matters that are ostensibly European, we are not always the first to intervene, to propose solutions, in short, to play the role that should be ours and come naturally to us. The United States, it must be acknowledged, is, financially speaking, by far, the primary supporter of Ukraine. This does not mean that the European Union is doing nothing. On the contrary, what Europe is doing is good, it is useful and indispensable, it is to our credit, but it is not enough. The question facing us is this: will we still be able to provide sufficient support to Ukraine, enabling it to defend itself against the Russian aggressor, should the political leadership of the United States no longer be the same as it was in 2022? The 2023, 2024, and 2025 financial years will therefore be of paramount importance. If we want to answer this central question, very little time remains for us.

Furthermore, this amending letter reduced the available amount from five and a half billion to just over three. This further narrows the scope for action. Insolvency, Commissioner, is not the best advertisement for the European project. Of course, I am speaking of potential insolvency, but we had those bad experiences from 2014-2016, and we must remember them. The second issue is inflation. It has already exceeded 10%. It will probably be a few percentage points higher by next spring. This impacts all expenditures, yet it is not reflected in the draft budget. And finally, the last point - aid for Ukraine. Even after this amending letter, it is absolutely underestimated, and aid for countries bordering Ukraine for receiving refugees is, in fact, merely symbolic.

Europe gave a clear answer to the unprovoked, brutal Russian aggression and took a stance together with the brave people of Ukraine. We all feel, we all see that a new and different Europe is being shaped by the war and that a new Europe is emerging, one that has to focus on key priorities and sound policies. This definitely means focusing on securing energy supplies, continued investment in security and defence and support for humanitarian aid, but also preventing the new migration crisis. The announced joint procurement act for the European defence industry is the right incentive for cooperation between the Member States, as well as for the industry that has been mobilised like never before. Likewise, with the European chips act, we have the possibility to increase Europe's independence with regard to semiconductor production in times when global supply chains are significantly disrupted.

We have some budgetary flexibility which is allowed, but it is not enough.

Therefore, we need to focus now on a revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework and find that delicate balance that the budget must achieve.

We must urgently abolish the discriminatory system for allocating direct payments, support young farmers by all means, provide everyone with access to technology and adequate energy, and invest in the protection of biodiversity.

Despite attempts to correct this absurdity and dismissive approach, the funds for 2023 are now frankly ridiculous. Once again, European politicians explained...\n",

      "\tMr President, Mr Minister, Mr Commissioner! I can certainly find merit in some savings proposals, but absolutely not for Horizon under Heading 1. Europe's future depends on four strategic cornerstones: research, development, innovation, and digitalisation. I know that many here have no understanding of economics and technology. But think of the Green Deal, which can only be implemented with new research findings and new technologies. Only 17% of global research and development expenditure originates from the European Union. And we also have catching up to do with investments in our companies. Here, we are proportionally behind the USA, China, Japan, and South Korea. Especially now, in a time of change, it is crucial to position ourselves strongly in global competition and to underpin our leadership, our claim to economic leadership. Therefore, the focus must be on programs that will certainly strengthen Europe in the geopolitical environment.\n",

      "\tMr President, the general EU budget for 2023 is a powerful political tool. There is a lot of politics within it, not just economics. In times of skyrocketing inflation and economic recession, politics must deliver. If politics does not deliver, we will see explosive populist upsurges, anti-system protests, and nationalist outcries. During the pandemic, we were able to basically double the EU budget: with Next Generation EU, SURE, REACT-EU, we acquired an additional EUR 1 000 billion – exactly like the multiannual financial framework. We were quite magical. Now we face a similar challenge with the energy crisis. Increasing resources for Erasmus+ and the Just Transition is good news, but it is not enough. We need fresh money from new own resources to provide immediate responses to gas deprivation and energy prices. We cannot lose the credibility we earned during the pandemic. We cannot lose the battle against inequalities and social despair. We cannot lose face in front of our people’s expectations.\n",

It is the last time I stand on this platform —the most democratic, liberal, representative, pluralistic platform, not only in Europe but in all of humanity— to comment on the 2023 budget. For eight long years, I have stood on this platform to truly commend the efforts of the European Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control. Today, all I have to offer from the bottom of my heart is a huge thank you to all the dear friends and colleagues who, together, within the Committee on Budgetary Control, fought battles and struggles for a more social, developmental, human European Union budget; for European citizens, for the peoples of Europe. A huge thank you for the cooperation and support I have received over the years from excellent colleagues, starting with the Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control. I also want to commend the support and cooperation of my colleagues from the European People's Party, especially my dear colleague and coordinator, José Manuel Fernandes, and to thank each and every one of you individually in the Committee on Budgetary Control. However, standing here, I want to highlight the tremendous efforts and emphasise that the European Union and the European Parliament are very fortunate, because at the helm of the European Union's budget is the esteemed Commissioner Johannes Hahn, who truly contributes immensely to the realisation of the European Union's visions. I truly thank you, Mr Vice-President, from the bottom of my heart, for all your cooperation. Unfortunately, this is my last intervention here, but I will have the privilege and opportunity, through my new duties and new position at the European Court of Auditors, to contribute to the realisation of the visions of the European Union and the European Parliament.\n",

      "\tThere is enormous power in our budget, and together with the Member States, we can definitely make a difference for ordinary people. But then we must have the strength to prioritize – and that determines on whose side we actually stand. Inequality continues to plague our continent, and we must not let those who are already disadvantaged be left behind in this crisis as well. For the rich can always afford the butter. The EU plays an important role. Joint investments in energy, research – they will ease things later on. But it takes time. Here and now, it is, after all, the Member States that must take responsibility for those who are struggling the most. With a new Swedish government concluding agreements at a castle, I am, to say the least, worried. The eagerness to reduce employment security and exclude the ill from social security takes precedence over helping ordinary people. 'The Castle Government' is there for its own. For society to hold together, everyone must be helped out of the crisis in both Sweden and the EU.\n",

      "\tMr President, Commissioner, Minister, between 2021 and 2024, the European Union will allocate over EUR 1 billion in funding to the Palestinian Authority. Fine, yet a proposal to condition just EUR 20 million of that funding is refused over and over by this House. I am referring, honourable colleagues, to the initiative which seeks to remove anti-Semitic references and incitement to violence propagated in the textbooks of Palestinian children. The EU is very clear that it has a zero-tolerance approach to anti-Semitism, and I would like to think that this is an approach that we all share. The Georg Eckert Institute study is clear that Palestinian textbooks do in fact contain anti-Semitic references. So I ask you, colleagues: why is it that a majority of this House refuses to condition EUR 20 million of the EUR 1 billion funding for the Palestinian Authority on removing the anti-Semitic references from the textbooks of Palestinian children? It is utterly perplexing that we failed to take this action. Funding conditionality is a routine feature of EU programmes. We condition commitments on a host of indicators from gender-mainstreaming to sustainability. So why is funding conditioning to fight anti-Semitism resisted so heavily? This is a question I put to colleagues ahead of the vote on the budget, and it is a question that I will continue to put in the times to come.\n",

      "\tMr President, Mr Commissioner, the debate we are having today, and which we repeat every year, is undoubtedly relevant, interesting and aligns the interests of the European Parliament and, with it, the representation of citizens. But it is also true that in these debates we always miss the structural changes that we must undertake in the Union's budget and, especially, after having issued hundreds of millions of euros in debt. A debt that we have to repay in the coming years. And, here, the budget debate links up with the discussion on own resources. Some own resources are on their way: there are legislative initiatives, hopefully soon in trilogue, to raise that financing that will allow us to amortise the debt. But there are others that remain pending. Some of them are: the digital levy, which is up in the air after the OECD agreements; the need to revise some type of taxation in the single market, also linked to the OECD agreement; and, perhaps, also the solidarity contributions from the energy sector that we have approved, that we have promoted through this Commission and the Council, and that we should, in some way, help to consolidate in the Community budget.\n",

      "\tDear Commissioner, dear colleagues, rapporteurs. The budget for each year is the most important political document we adopt, and it must at the same time follow a vision, promote development, and also respond to current situations that arise. The year 2023 is certainly an unpredictable year, one that will undoubtedly bring many more surprises. It is therefore right that the budget we are preparing is flexible to a certain extent and that it responds to the challenges posed by the war in Ukraine. Firstly, aid to Ukraine in its fight against the aggressor; secondly, aid to countries that have accepted refugees as a consequence of this Ukrainian war; and at the same time, throughout Europe, mitigating the consequences caused by this war. We are familiar with the problem of the energy crisis, which creates energy poverty, hardship for people, and causes a decline in economic strength and the competitiveness of our economy. It is therefore also necessary to find answers to this. Inflation is a particular problem. Amidst all these challenges, we must, of course, also ensure that we preserve these so-called classic policies, such as cohesion policy and agricultural policy. These are policies that best fulfil two principles: the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity. And these two policies are felt by the people. We must therefore make these policies simple and ensure that the absorption of these funds is even better in the future.\n",

      "\tMr President, as Vice—President in charge of Parliament’s budget, I would like to reaffirm our political will to negotiate constructively with other European institutions to reach a budget that can respond to our political priorities in these challenging times. But as Commissioner Hahn rightly said, the budgetary cuts proposed by the Council don’t even respect its own political priorities and this is not acceptable. From the point of view of Parliament’s budget, this context of war and high inflation implies the need to respond to the increase of expenses due to inflation, in particular the rise of energy costs; the need to strengthen our capacity to respond to the increasing cybersecurity challenges, including additional specialised human resources, and the need to be prudent in our building policy. That’s why I hope the amendment to this effect can be adopted. Finally, I hope that the budget, in its final version, can respond to these needs, meeting citizens’ expectations.\n",

      "\tEsteemed Chair, Commissioner, Minister, Rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is currently facing extremely complex challenges in the form of high energy prices, high inflation, questionable economic growth, and the consequences of the war in Ukraine. Science and research play a crucial role in fostering future growth and strengthening the resilience of the European Union and its economy to crises. The only way for Europe to remain competitive in the global market under these difficult circumstances is greater investment in innovation, especially that related to digitalization, where we certainly cannot compete with China and other global players on low prices. Therefore, any reduction in the budget for the Horizon Europe program is unacceptable. Furthermore, cohesion and agricultural policy cannot be the main source of financing for urgent priorities during the coming year, because this jeopardizes the implementation of long-term objectives. Support for rural areas and less developed regions must remain one of the main priorities in line with the true objectives of cohesion and the CAP. There is not and will not be a united Europe in which some are twice as rich as others, have access to top-tier health, education, and other public services, while others do not. Finally, I particularly emphasize healthcare as one of the priorities on which we must not economize. In this regard, it is especially important to strengthen long-term investment in European Reference Networks. They represent a huge step forward in enabling access to top-quality healthcare for all EU citizens, regardless of the country or region in which they live. In this way, we are investing and laying the foundations for a true European Health Union.\n",

We have this energy crisis. And I appeal to you, Commissioner, because you understand very well the challenges to which states in the immediate vicinity of the European Union are exposed. You were recently in Chișinău, you assured President Maia Sandu of the European Union's support. The Republic of Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia, and the other states need the European Union's support to overcome all these challenges coming from Moscow, in order to keep them in its sphere of influence.

Thanks to all the colleagues who have supported a reasonable, strong budget that responds to the European citizens. Mr President, a few years ago we went to war with a bow and arrows. But we live in an era where we are attacked with drones, where the world has caught fire, where we have five consecutive crises: the pandemic, inflation, energy, new candidate states – all these things must find a response today in what we do. We must change the weapons we have at our disposal, not blame the arrows. At this moment, we have different institutional opinions on the budget. The Council believes we need to make savings to have money reserved for future crises. But I ask myself, which future crisis, given that we already have the five crises I mentioned? What are we going to tell people: put another jacket on, or are we going to tell them that the European Union is trying to help you now? We, the Parliament, believe we must respond now, and that is why we are allocating the money we still have, as little as it may be, towards policies that matter to people, to the European Union, and we are united in this. In the Budget Committee, we had a vote of 31 to zero. Not even Mr. Kuhn's Eurosceptics, who said that the European Union should no longer have money or act, not even they dared to vote against. And I really want to ask Mr. Kuhn, who is obviously no longer in the room, what would Europe look like if we didn't react? Isn't the cost of inaction greater? And so, Mr President, and so, Commissioner, I encourage you to find the necessary solutions together, to find solutions now for the political crisis we are in.
