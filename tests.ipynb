      "I voted in favor of this report because I recognize that the European Globalization Adjustment Fund (CED) is able to give help and opportunities to those who have lost their jobs due to the economic crisis. This is an Irish case and involves 250 redundancies from Lufthansa Technik and 200 young unemployed people. The closure of this company has a huge impact on the local area in Dublin, and certainly, beyond that. He was located in a disadvantaged area with a low level of educational attainment etc. Along with that, these people have specific skills which means that it will be difficult for them to find another job in a different sector. However, with the money transfer of EUR 2 490 758, the people left without employment will now be able to learn new skills, which means that it will be easier for them to find another job in a different sector. Usually a minimum of 500 people are needed to apply to CED, so I welcome the way in which mitigation has been implemented so that people have access to this fund.\n",

At the same time, the EU is embellished and illusions are sown about its role. The KKE expresses its undivided support for the struggle of the Palestinian people and the continuation of their struggle by demanding: - The creation of an independent, sustainable, sovereign Palestinian state, on the borders of 1967 with East Jerusalem as its capital, next to Israel, the liberation of the Palestinian people from Israel's occupation. - The recognition of the Palestinian state, as a member state of the UN; its recognition by the Greek parliament and the Greek government. - The cessation of settlements and the departure of all settlers. - The demolition of the unacceptable wall in Jerusalem. - The return of all Palestinian refugees to their homes, based on the relevant UN resolutions. - The lifting of any blockade of the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. -The immediate release of all Palestinians and other political prisoners from Israeli prisons.\n",
      ". — The European Parliament resolution on the situation in the Mediterranean and EU migration policy seeks to strengthen the common anti-immigration policy of the EU and governments, the repression forces of FRONTEX, with its further funding by the Member States. This policy has already led to the death of thousands of migrants and refugees who, in their attempt to escape poverty, hunger and US, EU and NATO imperialist interventions in their homelands, are confronted by human trafficking rings and the repression forces. The growing waves of immigration are the result of imperialist interventions to control wealth-producing sources and energy transport routes, capital's needs for cheap labor power. We demand here and now immediate measures to welcome, accommodate and relieve immigrants and refugees; abolition of concentration camps and the Dublin II and III regulations; travel documents for those who wish to move to other countries.\n",

      ". - We Swedish social democrats are positive about investing in train traffic for the sake of the environment and to make it easier and faster to travel by train in Europe. The rail market in Europe needs to be coordinated more than today, for example with better integrated information and ticketing systems, and safety must be the highest possible. However, we do not believe that a common railway area based on deregulation and competition can solve the problems we face. Sweden and Great Britain are two bad examples of railway deregulation in Europe. The railways in the EU do not need more market thinking. Instead, increased investments in infrastructure and solid maintenance of existing tracks are needed. Cross-border rail traffic for both goods and passengers must also be greatly improved. A functioning, cohesive railway that is kept free from market experiments is significant both for employment and a reduced climate impact in the EU.\n",
      "(PL) Some time ago, Oleg Orlov said the greatest problem for the North Caucasus was the rejection by those in power of the most important issue – that of human rights. The violations of human rights are destabilising the situation in the North Caucasus, are prolonging the conflict, are reducing the chances for its resolution and are, in fact, creating support for underground terrorist activity. Human rights organisations such as Memorial should be supported because they are essential for the creation of a stable and free society, as also they are needed for the establishment of a stability which is real and lasting. These organisations should be supported, therefore, and it is also necessary to condemn the reprehensible deeds which are being perpetrated in the North Caucasus, to speak out for the growing number of people who have disappeared and to remember the suffering of those who have been displaced.\n",
      "(RO) The current economic crisis requires extraordinary measures at a time when an ever-increasing number of Europeans are facing the spectre of unemployment and financial recession. Raising the bank deposit guarantee ceiling for the general population is a welcome measure, which will maintain confidence in the banking system. An initial ceiling of EUR 50 000 and a further one of EUR 100 000 are more than adequate for the states whose banking systems have no long-established tradition, as is the case with Romania and other former Communist states. At the moment, it is important that each state adopts this measure, as otherwise there is the risk of causing panic among the population. Romania is not one of the states with a large number of deposits in excess of EUR 50 000. However, in psychological terms, raising the amount guaranteed can only have a positive impact, given that the population’s deposits have fallen, compared to September, by 6% in Bucharest alone. This means that around EUR 600 million have been withdrawn in the course of just a few weeks, which is unprecedented in recent years. On the other hand, as an MEP, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this measure needs to be supplemented by a review of the policies for granting credit and of the level of risk being assumed.\n",
      "(The speaker spoke in Irish)\n",
      "Mr President, there is indeed a crisis of succession in farming as Mr Parish with his expertise as a farmer knows well. If this crisis is particularly acute in Mr Parish's own Member State, it is the direct result of policies pursued by UK governments over the past twenty years, and to overcome it the United Kingdom must review the implications of the Fontainbleau Agreement for its contribution to European Union finances. This has been disastrous for farming. Moreover, the rapporteur, a member of the Conservative Party, must work within his own party to secure support for his proposals in the House of Commons. In countries where less than 10% of the population now lives in rural areas, it is too easy for governments to sideline the needs of these areas, and the message from this debate must be that they do so at the peril of their countries.\n",
      "Mr President, I, along with my Socialist colleagues very much welcome this report which underlines the work that we have done in the Budgetary Control Committee and really is built upon that. There are several very radical recommendations, not least the one that establishes the post of the European public prosecutor. Time and again many Eurosceptics have used fraud within the European Union institutions as a battering ram to beat us with. Of course any degree of maladministration and fraud must be weeded out. But this makes clear that 80% of the problem lies within the Member States themselves. The recommendation to establish a European public prosecutor, as proposed, would mean that there would be a mechanism to present criminal cases relating to EU fraud throughout the Union but it would not impinge on the jurisdiction of national courts. That is the way it has been written. It is sensitive to Member States’ worries. A series of shortcomings within the institutions have been identified in this report and recommendations are made here for correcting the problems. We look forward to developing the action programme for reform with the Commissioner responsible and although we have not had time to look at it in detail, I believe it would be fair to ask the Commissioner for a clear discussion and justification on why steps are not taken if some recommendations are left out. I am sure we will not agree with every single detail in this report but that would be a useful exercise nevertheless. The whole question of outside bodies doing work for the Commission is an area that needs clear attention. Whose responsibilities are the bureaus for technical assistance? Can we tighten-up the contracts granted to these bodies? How can we simplify procedures and make staff within the Commission more knowledgeable about tendering processes? The proposals outlined by Commissioner Kinnock in his hearing, in particular in the field of training, need more detailed response. We look forward to hearing more of his ideas over the next few months. I hope people will take time to read the report which clearly distinguishes between fraud and irregularity. The report states that of all the thousands of transactions which take place within the European Union institutions there are only 30 investigations involving Commission officials in fraud. Of course that is 30 too many, but the main cause of concern are the many examples of irregularities. This is an administrative problem, not a criminal issue. But measures are needed to tighten up the slack administrative practices, to rewrite poor regulations, to cut down complicated payment mechanisms, dispense with excessive exceptions and derogations which lead to the far too many irregularities and errors. It is these irregularities that give rise to alarmist headlines when we are presented with the Court of Auditors’ report on an annual basis. The report also correctly referred to the regulation on the protection of the financial interests of the European Community and points out that only three Member States have ratified the regulation. I am sure this report will give food for thought to those Member States that have not signed. It will be interesting to note how they respond in particular to the recommendation on the creation in each Member State of a national prosecution office for European offences. It is indeed appropriate that this report is published this week when we are about to decide on the fate of a new Commission. It is interesting in particular, in the light of recent events, that the Committee of Experts recommends that legal powers are given to allow the Commission President to sack individual Commissioners. This week we also received from the Commission a request on the supplementary and amending budget for money to establish the staff necessary to operate the new fraud office, OLAF. We would also concur with the report that specialised expertise is needed for these posts, and the need to make more effective use of information technology in intelligence gathering. The report itself should also be a lesson to us all within the European Union institutions. It has been clearly written, is really easily accessible and avoids jargon wherever possible. It is really a model on how to write European legislation. Having said that we welcome the move from ex ante to ongoing ex post control in the budget control mechanisms within the Commission. We would like to see that implemented. Again, we will have further discussions on that in the committee. We are at the dawn of a new era within the European Union institutions. We look forward to a time when officials are promoted on merit. We look forward to recruitment of people with appropriate expertise in specific sectors. We look forward to the commitments already made on whistle-blowers being implemented. But most of all we look forward to a time when every official and Member State Government responds to a new culture of responsibility. The next few months and years will be critical. But let us not forget that we have a base on which to build. The report is clear in its praise of the commitment and experience of most officials. From this week on a new chapter is being written. The plot is outlined in this report. It will be written by the Commission but Parliament will insist on strong editorial control. In partnership we can rebuild confidence in the institutions, not only for the people who work within them but most of all, for the people they serve.\n"
