         "Mr President, I’m actually speaking today on behalf of Mr Gieseke, who is not able to be with us. But I would like, on behalf of the PPE Group, to broadly support the motion that Parliament is putting forward. We are in line with the objective of formulating a comprehensive EU framework on endocrine disruptors. The motion highlights a number of areas where work is required and I guess if this was a school report, it would have some phrases such as ‘must work a little bit harder’. We certainly need the pace of investigation and validation of data to be speeded up and, whilst I appreciate the Commissioner’s points about the fitness check and I wholeheartedly support them, we are concerned about speed and we are concerned about making sure that we don’t let this particular issue slip. There needs to be investment in the whole issue of substances (we have highlighted that in Parliament’s text), substances used in mixtures and their joint and several effects. There is broad consensus on that. It’s been customary this week for Members to use their last speech in this Chamber and we’ve heard an awful lot of ‘this will be my last speech’. Well, I’d like to just go to that theme for a moment because for me, as a British MEP, I want to just mention one thing about Brexit and how it relates to this subject because Brexit has taught me a lot. It’s taught me never to pursue with blinkers on anything that’s ideological. Be very careful with decisions based on emotion, on gut feel, on belief. Be very careful about creating acts of faith, as opposed to action based on evidence. It can lead to disproportionate and damaging action that later causes regret and difficulties finding a way back. What’s that got to do with endocrine disruptors? Well, I think rather a lot because we do hear quite a lot of what I would call ideological hysteria about endocrine disruptors. I’m thinking here about Amendment 1, which is a good example. We will not be supporting it in the PPE. It calls for the same actions for suspected endocrine disruptors as for proven endocrine disruptors. This goes too far, it goes too quickly and it’s not based on scientific evidence. Secondly, on Brexit, we were told not to listen to experts. Well, on endocrine disruptors we must. We must look carefully at the scientific criteria and evaluate in a calm and systematic way. Broadly, we can support this statement. We do not support the amendments and we look forward in the next mandate to moving forward on this subject.",

These chemicals are present in many products and materials around us, including plastic bottles, children’s toys, cosmetics and food packaging. Europe must do everything possible to phase out dangerous substances, particularly those with endocrine disrupting properties. But in order to do so, we need the political will and we need concrete action. We feel that the European Commission did too little too late, because we have the strategic framework. However, there is still a lack of concrete action to provide full protection for human health and the environment. We are saying this because, even with the strategy, we are still excluding, for example, toys and cosmetics, and this only leads to a fragmented patchwork of different national standards, which makes it difficult for everyone, both for consumers, who do not know what level of protection they can expect, and also for producers, who suffer from diverging standards. We need a European course of action, and it needs to put people’s health and the environment first. We expect the European Commission to expand the scope to address endocrine-disrupting chemicals also in materials and products such as toys, cosmetics and food packaging. As socialists and democrats, we are pushing for a legal framework that can help protect our citizens. We are also asking for a horizontal definition of E disease that is aligned with the WHO’s definition. We believe that people have the right to know that their everyday environment and the products they use are not harmful to their health, and on behalf of the Socialists and Democrats I call on the European Commission to acknowledge the European Parliament’s resolution and our legitimate concerns, as it is time to phase out endocrine disruptors once and for all.",

         "Monsieur le Président, je siège dans cet hémicycle depuis 1999 et, en 20 ans, on ne peut pas dire que le cadre européen sur les perturbateurs endocriniens ait évolué, alors que la science, elle, a avancé. Des chercheurs ont révélé l’impact de ces perturbateurs sur la santé humaine et animale, ainsi que leur lien avec certaines maladies chroniques, en particulier certains cancers, avec l’infertilité et avec certains troubles du développement neurologique. Ce lien est avéré. L’Union européenne ne semble pas avoir pris la mesure de ce que l’OMS qualifiait, en 2013 déjà, de menace mondiale. Nous sommes très en retard. En 2015, la Cour de justice a condamné la Commission européenne pour son manque d’action en la matière. Quatre ans plus tard, on n’a pas beaucoup avancé, Madame la Commissaire, et cette nouvelle stratégie prend des airs d’acte manqué. Par exemple, la définition des perturbateurs endocriniens ne s’applique qu’aux produits phytopharmaceutiques. On sait pourtant aujourd’hui que 80 % des expositions se font par voie alimentaire. Il faut donc les interdire dans les conserves, dans les barquettes, dans tous ces matériaux qui sont destinés à entrer en contact avec la nourriture, dans les cosmétiques, aussi, cela a été dit, ou encore dans les jouets. J’ai vérifié hier: seules huit substances sont répertoriées comme des perturbateurs endocriniens dans la base de données européenne. Il y en a plus de 1 000! Une étude publiée il y a quelques jours indiquait que des traces de 90 perturbateurs avaient été retrouvées dans une seule rivière en France! C’est le grand écart: il faut accélérer les tests d’identification. Le bisphénol A, celui dont les effets néfastes sont les plus documentés, reste largement autorisé. L’Europe n’avance pas assez vite. Résultat: la Belgique, mais pas seulement, la France, l’Autriche, le Danemark, la Suède ont déjà commencé à avancer de leur côté et à légiférer. C’est sur ces sujets-là que la plus-value d’une harmonisation européenne prend tout son sens. Je vous engage à écouter les chercheurs pour protéger la santé et l’environnement des Européens. Cette stratégie ne va pas assez loin, nous devons agir plus vite et plus fort.",

         "Mr President, I have been sitting in this chamber since 1999 and, in 20 years, we cannot say that the European framework on endocrine disruptors has evolved, while science has advanced. Researchers have revealed the impact of these disruptors on human and animal health, as well as their link with certain chronic diseases, in particular certain cancers, with infertility and with certain neurodevelopmental disorders. This link is proven. The European Union does not seem to have taken stock of what the WHO described, already in 2013, as a global threat. We are very late. In 2015, the Court of Justice condemned the European Commission for its lack of action in the matter. Four years later, we have not made much progress, Madam Commissioner, and this new strategy looks like a failed act. For example, the definition of endocrine disruptors only applies to plant protection products. However, we know today that 80% of exposures occur through food. They must therefore be banned in canned goods, in trays, in all these materials which are intended to come into contact with food, in cosmetics, too, as has been said, or even in toys. I checked yesterday: only eight substances are listed as endocrine disruptors in the European database. There are over 1,000! A study published a few days ago indicated that traces of 90 disruptors had been found in a single river in France! This is the big gap: we must speed up identification tests. Bisphenol A, the one whose harmful effects are most documented, remains widely authorized. Europe is not moving fast enough. Result: Belgium, but not only France, Austria, Denmark, Sweden have already started to move forward on their side and legislate. It is on these subjects that the added value of European harmonization takes on its full meaning. I urge you to listen to researchers to protect the health and environment of Europeans. This strategy does not go far enough, we must act faster and stronger.",

         "Pane předsedající, já myslím, že je smutné, že zde dnes zase a znovu řešíme otázku endokrinních disruptorů. Komise svoji dlouhodobou nečinností ohrožuje zdraví celých generací svých obyvatel, kterým hrozí závažná zdravotní rizika. Od roku 1999, kdy Komise přišla s první strategií týkající se endokrinních disruptorů, jsme akorát promarnili čas, paní komisařko, ne že jsme udělali kus práce. Nebyli jsme schopni přijmout žádná vhodná opatření k minimalizaci expozice těchto látek vůči obyvatelstvu. Komise za celých poslední pět let neudělala v této věci nic, a to přesto, že jí to bylo soudně vytknuto jako pochybení. Endokrinní disruptory jsou všude, v potravinách a ve vodě, v jejich balení, v naší kosmetice, v léčivých přípravcích a dokonce i v hračkách, které dáváme našim dětem. Neexistují žádné vědecké pochybnosti o mnoha škodlivých účincích, jež tyto látky mají. Dali jsme výrobcům dostatečně dlouhou dobu, aby s nějakým řešením přišli sami. Nepřišli samozřejmě s ničím. Naopak, přišli jsme na to, jak rádi manipulují s fakty a vědeckými studiemi. Konflikty zájmů vědců je zjevně potřeba řešit intenzivněji, než jsme dělali do teď. Endokrinní disruptory musí být přísně regulovány stejně jako karcinogenní a mutagenní látky nebo látky toxické pro reprodukci. To znamená, že potřebujeme regulaci ve všech odvětvích, kde jsou v současné době přítomny. Musíme se ujistit, že je postupně co nejdříve úplně vyřadíme z používání. K tomu potřebujeme určit povinné požadavky na jejich testování a identifikaci. Musíme si uvědomit, že stejně jako v případě mutagenních či karcinogenních látek neexistuje žádná bezpečná prahová hodnota expozice vůči endokrinním disruptorům. Meze, které máme nyní, například pro bisfenol A, jsou stanoveny prostě příliš vysoko. Studie ukázaly nepříznivé účinky expozice bisfenolu A daleko pod těmito limity. Kolegové, to, že bych Vás ráda poprosila o podporu naší rezoluce, je samozřejmostí. Také bych vás ráda informovala o tom, že jsme k rezoluci podali několik vylepšujících pozměňovacích návrhů, o kterých se domníváme, že lépe vyjádří frustraci, kterou v této době v souvislosti s nečinností Komise máme. Na závěr bych vám jen ráda řekla, že i pokud přijmeme další kritickou rezoluci, nebude to stačit.",

         "Mr. President, I think it is sad that we are here again and again today dealing with the issue of endocrine disruptors. With its long-term inaction, the Commission is endangering the health of entire generations of its residents, who are at risk of serious health risks. Since 1999, when the Commission came up with the first strategy on endocrine disruptors, we have only wasted time, Commissioner, not that we have done any work. We have not been able to take any appropriate measures to minimize the exposure of the population to these substances. For the last five years, the Commission has done nothing in this matter, even though it has been accused of wrongdoing by the courts. Endocrine disruptors are everywhere, in food and water, in their packaging, in our cosmetics, in medicines and even in the toys we give our children. There is no scientific doubt about the many harmful effects these substances have. We gave the manufacturers enough time to come up with a solution on their own. Of course, they didn't come up with anything. On the contrary, we found out how they like to manipulate facts and scientific studies. Conflicts of interest among scientists clearly need to be addressed more intensively than we have done so far. Endocrine disruptors must be strictly regulated in the same way as carcinogenic and mutagenic substances or substances toxic to reproduction. This means we need regulation in all industries where they are currently present. We need to make sure that we phase them out completely as soon as possible. For this we need to determine the mandatory requirements for their testing and identification. We must realize that, just as in the case of mutagenic or carcinogenic substances, there is no safe threshold of exposure to endocrine disruptors. The limits we have now, for example for bisphenol A, are simply set too high. Studies have shown adverse effects from exposure to bisphenol A far below these limits. Colleagues, it goes without saying that I would like to ask you to support our resolution. I would also like to inform you that we have tabled several improving amendments to the resolution which we believe will better express the frustration we have at this time with the inaction of the Commission. In conclusion, I would just like to tell you that even if we adopt another critical resolution, it will not be enough.",

         "Monsieur le Président, Madame la Commissaire, j’avoue que cette législature est une occasion manquée sur les perturbateurs endocriniens. Mes collègues l’ont dit, l’OMS parle depuis 2013 de menace mondiale. Des milliers de publications scientifiques nous expliquent que les perturbateurs endocriniens sont en cause dans de nombreuses maladies chroniques: certains cancers hormonodépendants, l’obésité, le diabète, la perte du quotient intellectuel chez les enfants – parce que les femmes enceintes ingèrent des perturbateurs endocriniens et que cela peut avoir une répercussion sur le métabolisme des enfants –, l’infertilité, etc. Et vous, la Commission, que faites-vous? Vous gagnez du temps. Franchement, vous nous aviez dit avoir une stratégie en 1999, mais depuis 20 ans, qu’avez-vous fait? Qui vous a fait évoluer? C’est le Parlement européen qui vous a fait évoluer! Il a fallu qu’une ministre suédoise et le Parlement saisissent la Cour de justice européenne pour dire à la Commission: «Faites votre travail!». Vous étiez en dehors des traités européens pour définir, justement, ce qu’est un perturbateur endocrinien. En tant que parlementaire, je me dis: heureusement que nous, les parlementaires, sommes là pour protéger la santé des citoyens européens. Que proposez-vous? Qu’on se serve du principe de précaution, qu’on minimise l’exposition des gens. Les rapports de Mme Demeneix, du CNRS, et de M. Slama, de l’Inserm, nous montrent qu’il y a une augmentation de l’exposition des femmes enceintes et de l’ensemble de la population, mais vous ne présentez aucun plan d’action précis. Cette résolution que nous vous proposons, elle vous dit: «Allons-y!». Il n’existe même pas, sur le plan législatif, de définition commune, horizontale, des perturbateurs endocriniens présents dans les cosmétiques, les jouets, les additifs, les contenants alimentaires. Il n’en existe que pour les biocides et les pesticides. Et puis il y a REACH. C’est quand même incroyable! Quant aux tests d’évaluation, ils ne portent même pas sur l’ensemble des demandes d’autorisation des substances. De qui se moque-t-on? Je vous demande vraiment, pour la prochaine législature, d’avoir un plan d’action, de reprendre les propositions des parlementaires pour éliminer ces perturbateurs endocriniens, au même titre que les cancérigènes, les mutagènes et les reprotoxiques. Il en va de la santé des citoyens. Notre objectif n’est pas de faire prospérer les lobbies, mais de protéger la santé des citoyens… (le Président retire la parole à l’oratrice)",

         "Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I admit that this legislature is a missed opportunity on endocrine disruptors. My colleagues have said it, the WHO has been talking about a global threat since 2013. Thousands of scientific publications explain to us that endocrine disruptors are involved in many chronic diseases: certain hormone-dependent cancers, obesity, diabetes, loss of intelligence quotient in children – because pregnant women ingest endocrine disruptors and that this can have an impact on the metabolism of children –, infertility, etc. And you, the Commission, what are you doing? You save time. Frankly, you told us you had a strategy in 1999, but for 20 years, what have you done? Who made you evolve? It was the European Parliament that made you evolve! It took a Swedish minister and Parliament to go to the European Court of Justice to tell the Commission: “Do your job!” You were outside the European treaties to define, precisely, what an endocrine disruptor is. As a parliamentarian, I say to myself: fortunately we, parliamentarians, are here to protect the health of European citizens. What do you propose? Let us use the precautionary principle, minimize people's exposure. The reports from Ms. Demeneix, CNRS, and Mr. Slama, from Inserm, show us that there is an increase in exposure of pregnant women and the entire population, but you do not present any precise action plan. This resolution that we are proposing to you says to you: “Let’s go!”. There is not even, at the legislative level, a common, horizontal definition of endocrine disruptors present in cosmetics, toys, additives, food containers. There are only ones for biocides and pesticides. And then there is REACH. It's still amazing! As for the evaluation tests, they do not even cover all applications for authorization of substances. Who are we laughing at? I really ask you, for the next legislature, to have an action plan, to take up the proposals of parliamentarians to eliminate these endocrine disruptors, in the same way as carcinogens, mutagens and reprotoxicants. The health of citizens is at stake. Our objective is not to make lobbies prosper, but to protect the health of citizens... (the President cuts off the speaker)",

Si je me félicite en effet que cette révision des prévisions des ressources propres traditionnelles, notamment les droits de douane, conduise à une réduction de la contribution des États Membres au budget de l'Union européenne pour l’année 2015 de 9.4 milliards d'euros - soit pour la France 1,45 milliard d'euros - je ne peux cacher mon objection face à l'exhortation du rapporteur d'utiliser ces fonds supplémentaires disponibles en faveur d'un accueil \"sans précédent de réfugiés dans les villes et régions d'Europe\". La crise de ces derniers mois ainsi que le contexte d'insécurité qui a notamment mis à jour l'utilisation par les fondamentalistes islamistes des flux migratoires inconséquents pour entrer en Europe et commettre des attentats nous obligent à prendre la mesure de la réalité et à arrêter de financer cette immigration de masse, laquelle représente un danger non seulement pour notre sécurité, mais également une impossibilité au regard de nos capacités économiques et sociales d'accueil.",

         "I chose to abstain on the report on the draft amending budget which concerns own resources and the European data controller. While I am indeed pleased that this revision of the forecasts of traditional own resources, in particular customs duties, leads to a reduction in the contribution of Member States to the budget of the European Union for the year 2015 of 9.4 billion euros - i.e. for France 1.45 billion euros - I cannot hide my objection to the rapporteur's exhortation to use these additional funds available in favor of an \"unprecedented reception of refugees in the cities and regions of 'Europe\". The crisis of recent months as well as the context of insecurity which has notably exposed the use by Islamist fundamentalists of inconsistent migratory flows to enter Europe and commit attacks, force us to take stock of reality and stop to finance this mass immigration, which represents a danger not only for our security, but also an impossibility given our economic and social reception capacities.",

         "Herr Präsident! Bei 330.000 Asylantragstellern im Jahr – dies entspricht immerhin der Bevölkerungszahl von Städten wie Triest, Nizza oder Bonn – ist es sicherlich angebracht, genau zu überprüfen, ob Asylwürdigkeit gegeben ist und ob die vorgebrachten Behauptungen auch stimmen. Nichts spricht gegen EU-Mindeststandards. Aber es muss den Mitgliedstaaten auch erlaubt sein, unter Einhaltung internationaler Konventionen raschere und straffere Prüfungen durchzuführen. Denn eine endlose Kette von Rechtsmitteln führt schließlich zu einer Ersitzung des Aufenthaltsrechts, und das ist einfach nicht zu akzeptieren. Ich gratuliere auch der Schweiz, die vor kurzem ein Referendum durchgeführt hat, das wir leider in diesem Fall nicht haben. Die Schweiz hat sehr klare, straffe Regelungen beschlossen. Alleine die Tatsache, dass binnen 100 Tagen zu entscheiden ist, ist eine qualitative Verbesserung im Vergleich zur Lage in der Union, wo Asylverfahren sechs Monate dauern. Abschließend finde ich es sehr bedenklich, dass bereits nach neun Monaten der Zugang zum Arbeitsmarkt ermöglicht wird. Das öffnet Billigarbeit und Lohndumping Tür und Tor.",

         "Mister President! With 330,000 asylum applicants per year - this corresponds to the population of cities such as Trieste, Nice or Bonn - it is certainly appropriate to check carefully whether people are eligible for asylum and whether the claims made are true. Nothing speaks against EU minimum standards. But Member States must also be allowed to carry out faster and more stringent checks in compliance with international conventions. Because an endless chain of legal remedies ultimately leads to a denial of the right of residence, and that is simply unacceptable. I also congratulate Switzerland, which recently held a referendum, which unfortunately we do not have in this case. Switzerland has adopted very clear, strict regulations. The mere fact that a decision must be made within 100 days is a qualitative improvement compared to the situation in the Union, where asylum procedures take six months. Finally, I find it very worrying that access to the labor market is only possible after nine months. This opens the door to cheap labor and wage dumping.",

         "Madam President, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation, and a very special thanks also to my co-rapporteur, Roberta Metsola, with whom it was a great pleasure to work. And thanks, too, to the Ombudswoman who drew up the original report on which we now have this report. Altogether I think we are submitting a very good report to this plenary for you to vote on. It is a report that will protect the human rights of refugees and migrants at our external borders better, but it is also a report that will enable Frontex to have a clearer picture about where human rights violation might occur and how to solve this problem. It is a win-win situation. What we are proposing is to establish a complaints mechanism that refugees and migrants can use, through which they can address their complaints to Frontex if they feel that they have been mistreated in a Frontex operation – whether involving Frontex employees or guest officers of Member States. All these groups are recognisable by their Frontex armband, and therefore we think that we cannot expect refugees to try to research which Member State a specific guest officer might have been from. Rather, it is really important that they can address their complaints to Frontex and that we task Frontex, as we proposed to do, with making sure that those complaints actually arrive at the right place and are followed up, so that the Member States do not eventually need to follow up on those complaints. Of course, this will need sufficient resources in Frontex to handle the task because it is quite a new and significant task that we want to place in the trustworthy hands of the fundamental rights officer of Frontex. I am very hopeful that Frontex will now act swiftly in response to this request, without waiting until the next Frontex mandate review has been adopted, because that will take some time. I am glad too that the Frontex Consultative Forum sees implementation of the complaint mechanism as a core priority for its work next year. The Consultative Forum, by the way, is a body that the European Parliament helped to create in the last review of the Frontex mandate, so our work here in the Parliament is indeed essential to the functioning of our external borders agency. I believe that, with this complaint mechanism, we can take a further step towards ensuring even more human rights at our external borders. Frontex has, in the past, received more and more tasks, and it may receive even more in the future. So it is only right and fair that Frontex also has to do more on human rights. I hope this House can support our report, which we have been working on for several months now, with really great collaboration among the shadow rapporteurs and the co-rapporteur and with both the Committee on Petitions and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. I also hope that the Commissioner can give us a date when the complaint mechanism can be included in the next Frontex mandate review that he proposes, because I think it is very important that human rights safeguards keep pace with the enlargement of any task Frontex may have.",

         "Madam President, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation, and a very special thanks also to my co-rapporteur, Roberta Metsola, with whom it was a great pleasure to work. And thanks, too, to the Ombudswoman who drew up the original report on which we now have this report. Altogether I think we are submitting a very good report to this plenary for you to vote on. It is a report that will protect the human rights of refugees and migrants at our external borders better, but it is also a report that will enable Frontex to have a clearer picture about where human rights violation might occur and how to solve this problem. It is a win-win situation. What we are proposing is to establish a complaints mechanism that refugees and migrants can use, through which they can address their complaints to Frontex if they feel that they have been mistreated in a Frontex operation – whether involving Frontex employees or guest officers of Member States. All these groups are recognisable by their Frontex armband, and therefore we think that we cannot expect refugees to try to research which Member State a specific guest officer might have been from. Rather, it is really important that they can address their complaints to Frontex and that we task Frontex, as we proposed to do, with making sure that those complaints actually arrive at the right place and are followed up, so that the Member States do not eventually need to follow up on those complaints. Of course, this will need sufficient resources in Frontex to handle the task because it is quite a new and significant task that we want to place in the trustworthy hands of the fundamental rights officer of Frontex. I am very hopeful that Frontex will now act swiftly in response to this request, without waiting until the next Frontex mandate review has been adopted, because that will take some time. I am glad too that the Frontex Consultative Forum sees implementation of the complaint mechanism as a core priority for its work next year. The Consultative Forum, by the way, is a body that the European Parliament helped to create in the last review of the Frontex mandate, so our work here in the Parliament is indeed essential to the functioning of our external borders agency. I believe that, with this complaint mechanism, we can take a further step towards ensuring even more human rights at our external borders. Frontex has, in the past, received more and more tasks, and it may receive even more in the future. So it is only right and fair that Frontex also has to do more on human rights. I hope this House can support our report, which we have been working on for several months now, with really great collaboration among the shadow rapporteurs and the co-rapporteur and with both the Committee on Petitions and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. I also hope that the Commissioner can give us a date when the complaint mechanism can be included in the next Frontex mandate review that he proposes, because I think it is very important that human rights safeguards keep pace with the enlargement of any task Frontex may have.",

Pokud se podíváme na výpovědi těchto uprchlíků, pak většina z nich se bojí vrátit do své původní země. Chtějí jasné záruky. Bude hodně na nás, na evropské diplomacii, také na Vás, abychom tlačili Myanmar k tomu, aby poskytl jasné záruky, že na těchto lidech se násilí dále nebude opakovat. To násilí tam trvá desítky let a jedna dohoda ho určitě nevyřeší. Je třeba také tlačit na to, co tu říkali někteří kolegové, aby zločiny proti lidskosti byly vyšetřeny. Není možné říci, máme nyní dohodu s Bangladéšem a vše se vrací do původní situace a zapomeňte na to, že někde byly zavražděny tisíce lidí. Je třeba, aby tyto hrůzné zločiny byly vyšetřeny, a já jsem také pro to, abychom vůči Myanmaru řešili otázku sankcí.",

The fact that there is an agreement between Myanmar and Bangladesh still does not solve the Rohingya situation. If we look at the statements of these refugees, then most of them are afraid to return to their country of origin. They want clear guarantees. It will be a lot for us, for European diplomacy, for you too, to pressure Myanmar to provide clear guarantees that violence against these people will not be repeated. The violence there has been going on for decades, and one agreement will certainly not solve it. It is also necessary to push for what some colleagues have said here, so that crimes against humanity are investigated. It is impossible to say, now we have an agreement with Bangladesh and everything goes back to the original situation and forget that thousands of people were murdered somewhere. These terrible crimes need to be investigated and I am also in favor of dealing with the issue of sanctions against Myanmar.",

         "Herr Präsident, meine Damen und Herren! Als Ergebnis eines parteiinternen Machtstreits ist die EU am vergangenen Wochenende so weit gegangen, eine wesentliche Säule, die eigentlich die Konsistenz und die Struktur der EU beinhalten soll – nämlich die soziale Säule – , abzubauen. Herr Juncker, ich frage Sie: Was wird denn aus ihrem AAA? Was wird denn daraus? Es ist geopfert worden. Da könnten Sie jetzt eigentlich schon Ihre Sachen einpacken und könnten sagen: Das war's! Alle Versprechungen sind weg! Ich sage Ihnen auch, wir sind auf dem Weg, die EU nähert sich dem marktradikalen angelsächsischen Wirtschaftsmodell. Man könnte ja ein Denkmal in Brüssel errichten mit der Inschrift: „Hier wurde am 18. Februar 2016 der Geist von Margaret Thatcher wiederbelebt“. Danke. Das eigentliche Drama hat sich doch ganz woanders abgespielt und es spielt sich heute noch ab. Es sind die Hunderttausende Menschen, die in den letzten zwei Monaten nach Griechenland gekommen sind. Es ist die Weigerung der Europäischen Union, tatsächlich die Verpflichtungen einzugehen, nämlich für eine Umverteilung zu sorgen. Es ist Tatsache, dass der einstimmige Beschluss des letzten Gipfels – und den haben Sie nicht kritisiert, alle beide nicht – aufgehoben worden ist, einen Tag nach dem Gipfel war nicht mehr davon die Rede. Da werden die Grenzen dicht gemacht! Es ist aber vereinbart gewesen, dass bis zum nächsten März-Gipfel die Grenzen offen bleiben, dass darüber gemeinsam verhandelt wird und dass eine gemeinsame Entscheidung getroffen wird. Jetzt findet eine Konferenz in Wien statt unter – so muss ich sagen – Ausladung von Griechenland, dem Hauptakteur! Wie wollen Sie, wie wollen wir zu einer europäischen Lösung kommen? Da höre ich keine Kritik an dieser Praxis von Wien, auch nicht seitens der Kommission und seitens des Rates. Was wir brauchen, ist doch, dass wir endlich – und das haben Sie selbst gesagt, Herr Juncker – das, was wir beschlossen haben, einhalten. Das wäre die erste Voraussetzung, dass die entsprechenden Zahlen, die Kontingente auch übernommen werden und dass Griechenland hier geholfen wird. Wir brauchen einen legalen Weg, der muss geschaffen werden, hier muss Griechenland konkret geholfen werden. Hier kann man nicht mehr einfach so tun, als könnte man das einigen Mitgliedstaaten überlassen. Die Mitgliedstaaten stehen hier in der Pflicht, ihrer Verantwortung nachzukommen und das ist eine menschliche Pflicht. Wir geben unsere Werte auf, wenn wir uns dem verweigern. Das möchte ich auch noch einmal sehr konkret sagen: Sollen sich doch die Mitgliedstaaten ein Beispiel an der neuen portugiesischen Regierung nehmen, an dem Angebot von Costa an Tsipras, dass er Tausende von Migranten übernehmen wird, oder eben auch an der spanischen Provinz Valencia, die der griechischen Provinz Südägäis vorgeschlagen hat, tausend Migranten zu übernehmen. Warum können das die anderen Mitgliedstaaten nicht? Das wäre der Weg, das ist das Erfordernis, über das wir hier heute reden sollten! Nicht ein Machtspiel zwischen Johnson und Cameron, das mich in keiner Weise tangiert, das auch viele Flüchtlinge nicht tangiert, und darüber sollten wir hier reden. 24 Stunden Drama in Brüssel, ein inszeniertes Drama, das richtige Drama findet außerhalb statt und wir tun nichts! Wir reagieren nicht, wir tun so, als würde sich alles von alleine lösen. Ich denke, hier sind wir gefordert, und ich fordere auch Sie auf, meine Damen und Herren, dass wir hier gemeinsam agieren, dass wir eine Mehrheit bilden und klar und deutlich sagen, was notwendig ist. (Die Rednerin ist damit einverstanden, eine Frage nach dem Verfahren der „blauen Karte“ gemäß Artikel 162 Absatz 8 der Geschäftsordnung zu beantworten.)",

         "Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen! As a result of an internal party power dispute, the EU went so far last weekend as to dismantle an essential pillar that is supposed to contain the consistency and structure of the EU - namely the social pillar. Mr. Juncker, I ask you: What will become of your AAA? What will become of it? It has been sacrificed. You could actually pack up your things now and say: That's it! All promises are gone! I also tell you that we are on the way, the EU is moving closer to the market-radical Anglo-Saxon economic model. You could erect a monument in Brussels with the inscription: “It was here on the 18th. February 2016 “the spirit of Margaret Thatcher revived”. Thanks. The real drama took place somewhere else and is still happening today. It's the hundreds of thousands of people who have come to Greece in the last two months. It is the refusal of the European Union to actually undertake the commitments, namely to ensure redistribution. The fact is that the unanimous decision of the last summit - and you didn't criticize it, neither of you - was repealed; the day after the summit there was no longer any talk of it. The borders will be closed! However, it was agreed that the borders would remain open until the next March summit, that they would be negotiated together and that a joint decision would be made. Now a conference is taking place in Vienna with - I have to say - disinvited Greece, the main actor! How do you want, how do we want to reach a European solution? I don't hear any criticism of this practice from Vienna, not even from the Commission or the Council. What we need is that we finally – and you said this yourself, Mr Juncker – stick to what we have decided. That would be the first prerequisite that the corresponding numbers and the quotas are also adopted and that Greece is helped here. We need a legal path, it must be created, Greece must be given concrete help here. We can no longer simply pretend that this can be left to a few Member States. The Member States have an obligation to fulfill their responsibility and that is a human duty. We give up our values when we refuse to do so. I would like to say this again very specifically: the member states should take an example from the new Portuguese government, from Costa's offer to Tsipras that he will take in thousands of migrants, or from the Spanish province of Valencia the Greek province of South Aegean has proposed to take in a thousand migrants. Why can't the other member states do this? That would be the way, that is the requirement that we should be talking about here today! Not a power play between Johnson and Cameron, which doesn't affect me in any way, which doesn't affect many refugees either, and that's what we should talk about here. 24 hours of drama in Brussels, a staged drama, the real drama takes place outside and we do nothing! We don't react, we act as if everything will solve itself. I think we are called upon here, and I also call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to act together here, to form a majority and to say clearly and unambiguously what is necessary. (The speaker agreed to answer a question about the “blue card” procedure under Rule 162(8) of the Rules of Procedure.)",
