The government of the time responded by launching the largest humanitarian mission in the Mediterranean, Mare Nostrum. My thoughts today go not only to the victims, but also to those who are committed, every day, to saving human lives, to the women and men of the Italian Coast Guard, to the mayors involved in reception and integration, to the NGOs, unfortunately increasingly criminalized for their humanitarian activity. I would like this date to be remembered as Remembrance Day to honor all the men, women and children who lost their lives because they were forced to leave their country.\n",

      "[ ] 3: Manfred Weber (PPE - christian_conservative) [10% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, on 7 July 2019, almost exactly three years ago, the Prime Minister won the Greek elections in a landslide victory. The Greek people sent a strong message of support and trust to you, Prime Minister, and to Nea Demokratia to steer the future of Greece and turn a page on the failed policies of Alexis Tsipras and Syriza. When you came into office, Greece was in bad shape, I think that was obvious. After painful years of poor leadership by Tsipras, you put Greece back on track – and thank you for this remarkable and excellent work. Thanks to you and thanks to your government, Greece is back in Europe and that is good news. It is important for Europe to have Greece back. First of all, everybody, I think, should and must underline that Greece is in a way not a normal country because democracy was born in Greece. Our western civilization was born in Greece. Europe was born in Greece, not to mention the princess taken away by Zeus to beautiful Crete, the princess who gave her name to our old joint project, Europa. There is no Europe without Greece. Greece is back on economic issues. Last year, even in crisis times, the Greek economy grew by more than 8%. When it comes to growth, Greece is among Europe’s top five countries. You managed to reduce unemployment in Greece. In Greece, in the quarter from summer 2019 to February 2022, more than any other country, you did it and the people feel the success in their daily life. Thanks to your efforts and to the determination of the government, Greece is finally also on the way to exiting the surveillance programme. On another aspect, Greece is back and that is about the security issues. Since you took over, Greece seriously cares about security again. Greece, due to its geographic position, is key when it comes to European security. Europe is not to be criticised but to thank Greece for protecting and defending our common external borders. And I want to be very clear on this, and I see that each and every single event on the border between Turkey and Greece is in this European Parliament an issue, and it’s okay that we discuss the issues. But on the other hand we saw in Spain, on the Spanish-Moroccan border, an event where more than 20 people died. And I have to tell you that the Socialists and the Greens didn’t initiate a debate about the events in Spain, but they initiate always a debate when it is about Greece. So we should care about the migrants and not about party political issues when it is about migrants. I have to be clear on this, that the PPE is strongly on the side of our Greek authorities. Erdoğan is misusing migrants as a political weapon like Lukashenko did. For us that’s clear. Our border guards, who are doing everyday the job of protecting people and the border, we trust them, we are respecting their work every day in the interests of all of us. What we have to do is to strengthen Frontex and what we have to do is also to clarify the rules for pushbacks, and I want to thank Margaritis Schinas for his work in this clarification process. Greece is back also on geopolitical issues. Tsipras, I have to say, mainly cared about Maduro. You care about the European interests in the Mediterranean, and that is good. Not only in the last years do we witness an increasingly destabilising role played by Turkey, dangerously raising the tensions in the region. What Turkey is doing is unacceptable. It is not a problem between Greece and Turkey, but a problem between Europe and Turkey. Greece’s interests are European interests in this border conflict. And we all have to ask ourselves, and probably, Mr Prime Minister, you can reflect a little bit in your final statement, how do we best deal with Erdoğan’s Turkey, a Turkey that is becoming more and more provocative and aggressive? And Greece is back on foreign and defence issues. Putin and Erdoğan tell us one lesson – Europe must grow up when it comes to foreign and security policy. It is great news that Finland and Sweden have finally joined NATO. And as PPE, our parties in Finland and Sweden always fought for becoming NATO members. The Socialists finally also supported this approach. The PPE is fully supporting NATO, but we also think that Europe has to grow up. We must abolish the unanimous vote principle in the Council side when it comes to foreign affairs, and within NATO we have to build a true common European defence with concrete projects like a cyber-brigade or a European missile defence system. Europeans have to be capable of defending themselves if it is needed. And if you will allow me, I want to finalise with a more general consideration, because you delivered, Mr Prime Minister, a great speech in the US Congress and in the Senate a few weeks ago. It was a big honour for you to be there as one of the European leaders. And when we look to the US and we also look to our European democracies, we have to see that these democracies are under stress. We are facing populism and extremism, and probably most fundamental question is, can we agree still in our societies about what is true, what is the reality? Because we have fake news discussions – you mentioned this – we have propaganda from China, from Russia, which tried to change what is true, the reality which we are based on. And without the common understanding in our societies about what is true, what is the reality, you cannot build up a lively democratic discussion between Greens, Socialists, the PPE and so on and so forth, and people cannot decide. That’s why the idea to strengthen this common base is so important. The fight against propaganda, too often this is unanswered. We have to strengthen good and serious journalism, and we have to make clear that the tech giants have a responsibility. We will vote this week on the DMA and the DSA, which would give and will give an answer on these challenges. So thank you, dear Kyriakos, thanks to you Greece is back in Europe. The Greek people can be proud about these achievements.\n",
      "[ ] 4: Νίκος Ανδρουλάκης (PSE/S&D - social_democratic) [0% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, over the last decade, Europe has been confronted with successive crises which have exacerbated inequalities to an extreme degree. The inability to reach understanding, achieve consensus, and provide comprehensive answers to these challenges has made the era of convergence seem like a distant past. The more opportunities for a better life dwindle for millions of European citizens, and the more they feel excluded from a society of equal opportunities, the more threats to liberal democracy will increase. The stagnation imposed on the project of political integration by Europe's conservative forces created an opening for those who reject the European vision to exploit it to their advantage. This is the duo responsible for us remaining, Mr. Prime Minister, a slow-moving ship, as you said a few weeks ago. Some speak in the name of Europe, without doing anything – and I am referring to the conservative forces – while others constantly attack it with Manichaean arguments at every opportunity. Elitism and populism are equally destructive to the European vision. The world, however, is changing, and we must rise to the occasion. We have a duty to do more, and to do it now. We must defend, through a progressive political plan, social justice, solidarity, human rights, and environmental protection. We must make citizens feel safe again against the geopolitical, climatic, and economic challenges of our time. Positive steps, such as the Recovery and Resilience Facility, must acquire permanent characteristics, especially for the Greek people who experienced harsh economic policies. It should be utilized as a tool for social cohesion and strengthening the resilience of our society and economy. I would like to make an aside. It is good to remember the humiliating referendum of 2015, but let us be fair. And remember very well the humiliating era of 2009 when you led the country to a 15.6% external deficit and to bankruptcy, as certified by the resolution of the European Parliament, because these choices by the conservative faction were what opened Pandora's Box in Greece. We must, therefore, talk about young people and create new opportunities to reduce emigration and to strengthen the purchasing power of Greeks, which is the second lowest in Europe. According to Eurostat data, Greek citizens are proportionally burdened much more than other Europeans. There is no provision in the Recovery Fund for the construction of social housing for rent at low cost, as other European countries with similar problems have done. In the healthcare sector, the fact that Greeks rank third in Europe for private expenditure is indicative of the real needs that exist, and the National Health System and primary care must be further strengthened. To address the climate crisis, the Recovery Fund could be the primary lever for the widespread adoption of renewable energy sources through household photovoltaics and energy communities. We have the strange peculiarity that while throughout the European Union the goal is the complete decarbonization of the economy, you are limiting yourselves only to de-lignitisation, as demonstrated in the recent climate law you voted for, making the country vulnerable to expensive and imported natural gas. The European Commission offers the possibility to revise national plans so that investments can now be included in them, such as the upgrade of the country's electricity grid through storage and all the necessary measures we need to strengthen energy autonomy and a just transition. However, I also want to refer to the need for geopolitical security. Putin's illegal and destructive invasion of Ukraine is a tragic event for the Ukrainian people and a very costly lesson for the European elites on how they must deal with authoritarian revisionist leaders. Appeasement, as proven, yields no results. Strong deterrent measures are needed. There is no other path for a strong and self-reliant Europe that will not be a follower of United States foreign policy. That is why I call on you to take a stand. The Greek people, through ten years of continuous crises, have lost almost 25% of their GDP and are forced to pay billions to safeguard the sovereignty of our homeland through armaments programs, while at the same time European states continue to arm those who threaten our sovereign rights. Therefore, a decision must be made here for an arms embargo on Turkey and on anyone who does not respect international law. And I am very pleased that Mr. Weber, in a recent interview, said he supports this. You support it now. However, when the amendment came from the socialists, you personally voted against it. Furthermore, it is inconceivable for European heads of state to adopt Erdoğan's narrative on terrorism, when in Turkey anyone who disagrees with his authoritarian practices, such as Kavala and Demirtaş, is automatically branded a terrorist and an enemy of the nation. Dear colleagues, dealing with leaders who flagrantly violate international law is not a matter for one or two countries, but for all of us. It is our duty for all citizens of the European Union to feel equally safe, wherever they live, from Sweden and Finland to Greece and Cyprus. Therefore, we need to proceed with the necessary institutional changes so that there can finally be a common foreign, defence, and security policy. At a critical moment in history, where nightmarish scenarios reveal our limitations and the past mistakes of all, we have a duty to breathe new life into the European vision, making it once again captivating and hopeful for all European peoples.\n",
      "[ ] 5: Malik Azmani (ELDR/ALDE/Renew - liberal) [13% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, Prime Minister, honourable Members, we face a series of alarming challenges that deserve the attention of the solidarity of all of us. The unjust and uncalled for war of aggression raged by Russia in Ukraine is triggering new crises – an energy crisis, food shortages – and these two combined will lead to an economic and perhaps migration crisis. This continent needs to get ready for all of this, doing so while helping the Ukrainians fight their good fight. It’s quite simple: Mr Putin must fail. Therefore, we must stand by the Ukrainian people with determination, and sanctions alone are not enough to ensure Putin’s failure. Ukraine needs our heavy weapons and here all of us have a duty to back our words with actions. There is one man responsible for the food crisis – that’s Vladimir Putin. Food shortages risk many vulnerable adults and children. And they are also a risk of a migration crisis for Europe. And I’m quite certain that a new migration crisis would seem very attractive to Mr Putin, but we cannot let him succeed. We need to finalise a new European migration and asylum pact. We need a strict and fair system for the whole Union to work but we need the whole Union to take its responsibility, and we need to do it now. We have waited for too long and the next migration crisis might be on our doorstep already. The Council needs to move and this House needs to engage in pragmatic negotiating with them to reach a deal before the end of this year. I’m worried when I read some of the reports of violent deportations. Yes, we must uphold EU law and yes, we must protect EU borders, and yes, we must ensure Turkey abides by its obligations to us. But we say no to illegal pushbacks of any kind – in Spain, in Greece or anywhere else. Mr Prime Minister, I hope you can agree with us in Renew Europe that the Europe of today needs to be bold so we can address the cost of living crisis facing Europeans. Like the common solutions we found for the pandemic, innovative thinking is needed to address our energy challenges. We need to boost our economic credentials by signing the free trade deals that are frozen. The deal with New Zealand last week shows us the way. Protectionism is no antidote to inflation. By investing in the modernisation of our economies, by embracing competition, by improving our entrepreneurial and investment climate, we can continue to sail the ship of prosperity. Let us be bold and fight back against global economic headwinds. And then, finally, we see that in many countries, even within the European Union, the values and principles that breathe life into our democracies are under attack. And I will be frank, Prime Minister, as always. We are worried about the decline in press freedom and media pluralism in Greece. The warning lights are flashing. Greece now has the worst performance in the EU27 as far as media freedom is concerned. Mr Prime Minister, I hope you agree with me that media freedom is central to our European way of life. Renew Europe has added a distinguished Greek MEP, Mr Georgios Kyrtsos, to its ranks. He is sitting over there on the first row. Our family expects the voice of its representative to be heard, according to European media rules and standards. We do not want to see another EU government leader slandering the free press because, as you know, it was Socrates who said, ‘When the debate is over, slander becomes the tool of the loser’ and we are aware that some in your political family have set a bad example, but please, Prime Minister, don’t follow in their destructive footsteps. Stop it, Prime Minister, and stop silencing Mr Kyrtsos and stop it now. Hold the pride of the Greek tradition of public debate alive and you will continue to find Renew at your side, facing the crisis ahead together in unity.\n",
      "[x] 6: Tineke Strik (Greens/EFA - green) [37% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, I thank you and the Commissioners. Dear Prime Minister, welcome in our House and I also welcome the Minister of European Affairs. During the eurozone crisis, we have painfully witnessed in Greece how citizens suffer if the EU fails to act in unity and solidarity, and citizens should never any more pay the price of a functioning monetary and economic union. Greece should be able to count on the Union to fully reap the benefits of the green transition. But we also count on Greece to defend the fundaments of the Union: a Europe based on democracy, rule of law, media freedom and non-discrimination. A Europe that respects fundamental rights, including human dignity and the right to apply for asylum. And I wonder is this Europe as well, Prime Minister, if asylum seekers try to enter this Europe through your country, their rights are brutally trampled? They are pushed into the Turkish waters and land. Migrants are even forced to push back other migrants and the border guards – masked men putting lives at risk – enjoy impunity. But those who save lives are convicted. And therefore, I ask you, Mr Mitsotakis, is this Europe? You’re closing down the most humane camps and have forced asylum seekers to live in remote and closed hotspots. You lose thousands of asylum seekers from Syria and Afghanistan in a legal limbo, using the fiction that they could return to Turkey, which they can’t. And the lucky refugees that do get a status have to survive on the streets. Yet, those helping refugees are restricted and criminalised; those who speak up, including media, are silenced. But, Prime Minister, covering up evidence doesn’t help, because the reality is recorded and reported time and time again by all relevant bodies of the UN, Council of Europe, by ombudsmen, NGOs and investigative journalists. And European judges refuse to accept this reality as it violates EU asylum law. That, Mr Mitsotakis, is Europe. And let me be clear: other Member States have put Greece in an unfair position. They breached the principle of solidarity by refusing a common responsibility for asylum seekers. We could be allies in combating these selfish policies and to have geopolitical answers to geopolitical conflicts. But sealing off the borders, deterring and pushing back refugees is not the European answer. And, instead of trying to demonstrate a shield for Europe, I urge you to solve the many problems in your society. People are suffering from it: the 36.8% of young people unemployed; the high level of poverty; the increasing use of fossil fuel riding this global crisis, instead of investments in renewable energy. Use the EU funds to create innovative green and social jobs to transform your country into an inclusive, modern and sustainable state. Prime Minister, we count on Greece to honour the fundamental rights on which true European solidarity can be built, both for the Greek citizens and for the refugees. Because there is no Europe left to protect or to defend if its core values are undermined.\n",
      "[ ] 7: Gunnar Beck (ENF/ID - (extreme)_right) [14% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, I wish to welcome Prime Minister Mitsotakis to the European Parliament. I would like to congratulate you, Mr Mitsotakis, more than once. First, on paying off your debt to the IMF two years ahead of schedule. However, the euro is quite another matter. It has not served Greece well. Greek inflation stands at 12%. Rents in Athens are up about 17% and petrol prices are approaching EUR 3 per litre. Almost 30% of Greeks are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. One million Greeks work in the tourist sector, but the rental costs of sunbeds in exclusive resorts in Mykonos now equal the monthly minimum wage in Greece. Price rises of up to 110% for Greek hotel rooms far exceed those in other holiday destinations. Lay—offs in the Greek tourist sector therefore seem inevitable. Second, I would like to thank you for your efforts in protecting Europe against the ongoing migrant invasion. Last week you decided to triple the length of the border fence with Turkey and you prevented smugglers from offloading over 1 000 illegal migrants on Greek islands. Third, I applaud your resolve in resisting aggressive posturing from Ankara. Greece’s territorial integrity should be sacrosanct to the EU, more self—evidently so than that of neighbouring non—EU countries. On the other hand, Prime Minister, I firmly disagree with you on the expansion of the European Empire. With the highest inflation rate since the 1970s, this is not the time to waste energy and money on making the Western Balkans ‘fit for 55’. Rather, we should focus on the Greek pension of EUR 384 per month and the 14 million Germans who live near or below the poverty line. Further, your government recently decided to follow Germany in ordering F—35 American fighter jets. Instead, you could have favoured European options to protect European, not American, workers and jobs. Finally, at a recent press conference on demographic change, you seemed to adopt the logic of replacement migration, commending the integration of populations from Asia and Africa as a viable alternative, or as a viable solution to low fertility rates, instead of favouring imaginative family policies, Hungarian style. The truth is that European governments have failed us for 40 years. Even Europe’s richest countries were never rich enough to allow most families to raise two or three children in modest comfort. They are now importing millions of migrants which will rarely work and usually live on welfare. Sadly, our EU leaders are destroying our welfare state through the back door – and European culture and civilisation with it. Prime Minister, I implore you to resist von der Leyen’s ‘great replacement’. Greece was under Ottoman rule for centuries. You have no reason to adopt Germany’s guilt complex.\n",
      "[ ] 8: Εμμανουήλ Φράγκος (ECR - (extreme)_right) [0% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, Prime Minister, thank you very much for your presence. For my part, as a young Greek who has been given the opportunity to speak, I would like to address the specific problem of brain drain, a phenomenon of young scientists leaving abroad to find work and a better future, with, of course, undeniably severe consequences for our homeland. Having recently completed my studies at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, I found that leaving abroad is an attractive option for 8 out of 10 of my colleagues. For example, during the eight-year period from 2008 to 2016, it is estimated that approximately half a million young Greek students and graduates left, at a cost of about 15 billion euros, as reported by the National Higher Education Authority.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tBut what is this due to? Firstly, unemployment. According to Eurostat's monthly survey, Greece ranks first in youth unemployment with a rate exceeding 30%. We are among the last OECD countries in terms of employment of young graduates aged 25-34, lagging the average by fourteen percentage points. Secondly, low wages make it difficult to make a living. Unfortunately, young Greeks often, in order to remain in our country, are forced to do something completely different from what they studied. Of course, education is not free. The cost to the Greek state is estimated at 33,000 euros per graduate, yet their skills are ultimately put to use by another country. We can understand that Greece only suffers losses from this situation. Our young people are thus forced to leave Greece to find a well-paid job that aligns with their knowledge and what they studied.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tUniversities, therefore, have not been sufficiently connected in Greece and within the European Union with the labour market. There isn't what we call an ecosystem that encourages young people to start businesses and innovate, and, crucially, to use their knowledge. As we know, however, work can truly make our young people independent so that they want to remain in Greece — not as clients, but as citizens — and, of course, to be able to start families, so that we can address the enormous demographic problem. So, in addition to the underutilization of our outstanding scientists, we must also consider a subsequent problem. This is none other than the demographic issue. I remind you that, nowadays, for every two adult Greeks, there are approximately 1.2 children, whereas we need more than 2 to sustain ourselves as a nation. Our nation, however, is fading, and the Greek family is disappearing. Our young people, brilliant minds, excellent scientists, and essential for our country, must return. We often see young Greeks in the news innovating, starting businesses, and excelling in foreign countries, but we wonder why this is not happening in Greece.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tIn your pre-election speeches, you spoke extensively about addressing brain drain. Post-election, you attributed the root of the problem to universities, and in reality, very little has been done. I would therefore like to ask you two fundamental questions on this particular issue: first, whether Greece can bring back all those Greeks who left during the last decade of the crisis, and second, how you plan to reverse this phenomenon.\n",
      "[ ] 9: Δημήτριος Παπαδημούλης (NGL/The Left - left) [6% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, Mr. Mitsotakis, welcome to the European Parliament, but I want to tell you from the outset that your government's failure cannot be hidden by attacks and slanders from the very first seconds of your speech against the previous Greek government. Mr. Weber and Mr. Mitsotakis —because you too, Mr. Weber, began with attacks and personal slanders against the former Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras—, I want to tell you that such obsessions indicate that you may even see Tsipras in your sleep! In a democracy, citizens decide. Yesterday Tsipras was Prime Minister, today it is Mitsotakis, tomorrow, if the Greek people wish it, it could be Tsipras again. We must respect the truth; and the truth says that the New Democracy party bears enormous responsibility for the country's bankruptcy, because it left it in 2009 with a deficit of 15.4% and huge public debt, a clientelist state, corruption, oligarchs, and cronyism. It brought the country into the memoranda, and the Samaras-Venizelos government —in which Mr. Mitsotakis was a leading minister—, blew up the bank: 27% unemployment, huge social inequalities, huge regression. And, instead of the convergence that was the expectation of Greeks when we joined the European Union, 40 years ago, based on what Konstantinos Karamanlis and Andreas Papandreou promised, we have divergence. And you should have talked to us about these things, Mr. Mitsotakis. Greece has the highest inflation in all of Europe: 12% —40% above the Eurozone average—, the second most expensive petrol price in the European Union. According to Eurostat, in terms of citizens' purchasing power, it is 26th out of 27. And you bear a large share of responsibility for this, because apart from imported inflation, we have a party of profiteering and speculation. Greece remains first in public debt and has plummeted, during your years in government: 27th out of 27 in press freedom and 43 positions down in the World Index in 3 years, to position 108. Do you insist, Mr. Mitsotakis, that Reporters Without Borders is an unreliable non-governmental organization? Because I want to give you some news: we, in the European Parliament, consider it very reliable, it is our institutional partner, as it is for the Commission and the Council of Europe and the UN, and in a few hours, together with Ms. Metsola, the President of the European Parliament, we will meet with Reporters Without Borders, whom you slander, to strengthen our cooperation. Tell us, then, why Greece remains first out of 27 in youth unemployment and 27th out of 27 in gender equality? Why in the three years of your government do we have the highest number of pandemic deaths per million inhabitants in all of Western Europe? And one more thing: everything that Mr. Azmani on behalf of the Renew Europe Group and Ms. Strik on behalf of the Greens Group told you, about the need to control illegal pushbacks, is also stated by the European Parliament with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, it is also stated by Commissioner Johansson, and they must be controlled because these things are not good for our country —as is the regression of the rule of law. And because I learn that Ms. Vestager asked you for modernization and reforms for the faster administration of justice in Greece —as the slow administration of justice is also an obstacle to investments and the utilization of funds from the Recovery Fund—, I would like, Mr. Mitsotakis, one more thing from you in your second speech: in January in Parliament, you characterized leading Greek journalists and researchers as \"underworld\" and \"gang.\" The Supreme Greek Judicial Council —judges chosen by the leadership of justice, whom you appointed—, unanimously and solemnly acquitted these journalists of all charges. Do you intend to apologize, even once, for the severe characterizations \"underworld\" and \"gang\"? And one last thing about the Recovery Fund: Portugal will use Recovery Fund money to build tens of thousands of beds and apartments for young couples, students, and university students. How will you build them with the money from the Recovery Fund?\n",

In the last two years, Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine has concentrated our efforts, but it cannot make us forget the Southern Neighbourhood. The serious risk of escalation in the Middle East, the difficulties faced by the countries of the Southern Neighbourhood, or the situation in the Sahel are profound challenges that the European Union cannot ignore. We must act. The agreements with Egypt, or the recent ones with Tunisia and Mauritania, are therefore heading in the right direction. Egypt is a very important neighbour, with significant geostrategic weight. The joint declaration of 17 March, promoted by President Von der Leyen, elevates our partnership with Egypt to a strategic level. This will facilitate political dialogue at the highest level, contribute to strengthening the country's stability, and improve its capacity to face current economic and security threats. Egypt is indeed experiencing a very difficult economic situation, marked by high public debt, elevated inflation, and a severe shortage of foreign currency. I hope that this partnership will contribute to stabilising the country's economy and promoting the necessary structural reforms. This partnership covers other equally important topics — as Vice-President Schinas told us — such as investments in energy, cooperation in the field of migration, or student exchanges — Erasmus+ —, among others. The promotion of democracy, human rights, and fundamental freedoms is also present in the partnership with Egypt. Ladies and gentlemen, Egypt has a great capacity for dialogue with Israel and Palestine. In the current difficult circumstances in the region, Egypt must continue working to achieve a ceasefire and the release of hostages, and to continue facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The European Union cannot aspire to be a global actor if, in its own neighbourhood, it is unable to actively defend its interests and values and act in a cohesive and effective manner. We must contribute decisively to the stability and prosperity of our neighbourhood, which is currently going through a very difficult period.\n",

We were surprised. In March this year, the process is repeated, now with Egypt, for 7.4 million euros. Loans, investments, and aid for migration-related programmes. All of this without this Parliament exercising its role of democratic scrutiny. The way the European Commission bypassed this Parliament in concluding these agreements is unacceptable. It is inexplicable – and remains unexplained – how agreements of this nature, which must have involved lengthy preparation, do not pass through Parliament? We want to know what conditionalities – beyond the general conditionalities – the Commission established with these agreements with Tunisia and now with Egypt. Was there urgency? We cannot validate these agreements under the argument of urgency, because that is not true. Today we have a new Pact on Asylum and Migration. The European Parliament demonstrated throughout the 9th legislative term that it can act quickly. We did so, for example, in the European response to COVID-19. The European Parliament is the budgetary authority. It does not relinquish its powers, and we cannot think that it is through urgent disbursements that we will become relevant in the Southern Neighbourhood. This is a very limited and very unstrategic view of the problem.\n",

And it is right that we conclude comprehensive agreements with such strategic partners, covering all policy areas. However, I find it particularly important to emphasise that it is stipulated that financial support for Egypt is tied to the fulfilment of conditions. The conditions mentioned therein are concrete steps towards effective democratic mechanisms. And it is absolutely right that such conditions exist, honourable colleagues. Unfortunately, in my view, it is not concrete enough as it is written here. One thing is clear: Today, there is virtually no opportunity for civil society in Egypt to express itself openly and critically about the current government. In my view, structural reforms for more human rights and a functioning rule of law are urgently needed in Egypt. And regarding migration management, it must also be absolutely clear, in my view, that human rights are non-negotiable, honourable colleagues. The documented abuses that also occur in Egypt, for example, involving refugees from Sudan, must be investigated and must not form the basis for cooperation between the European Union and Egypt.\n",

As the standing rapporteur for Egypt in this institution, I have consistently called for strong and precise conditionalities regarding this regime. Through your sleight of hand, Ms von der Leyen ended up receiving a very clear recommendation from the Council. The Council asks you to implement concrete conditionalities in your report to the Sisi regime. If you have no ideas, I will give you some: lift censorship on independent media, release the 60,000 prisoners, stop the pressure on civil society and the opposition, protect sexual equality and the rights of minorities, migrants, and refugees. Today, Mr Commissioner, 18 women were arrested by the Sisi regime because they were demonstrating in front of the United Nations office with a simple petition on the situation in Gaza and Sudan. Where are human rights in this country? Where are the commitments of this regime? After having disregarded Parliament, will Ms von der Leyen also disregard the Council and its recommendations?

      "\tMr President, Egypt is an essential partner for France and the European Union in Africa. Cairo is currently facing immense challenges. Egypt must strive for food, energy, economic, and financial sovereignty, amidst a particularly degraded neighbourhood. The European Union therefore has everything to gain by standing alongside it. While everyone acknowledges Cairo's decisive role in the pursuit of peace in the Holy Land, Egypt's actions are also beneficial elsewhere, both for its region and for the European Union. In Sudan, Egypt plays an essential humanitarian and diplomatic role, while also hosting refugees from the civil war tearing the country apart. At its Libyan border, Egypt ensures the fight against terrorism, just as it has done for years in the Sinai. While the dark hours of the country's domination by Mohammed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood have barely faded, Cairo has regained its pivotal role in international negotiations. I can therefore only welcome Egypt's participation in the Horizon Europe programme. I hope this progress heralds further advancements, particularly regarding a partnership for migration prevention. This is also an excellent signal for European businesses, which benefit from the new prospects opening up in this territory. France is already at the forefront of projects related to the Cairo Metro, but would benefit from investing more in developing Egyptian markets, such as the construction of the New Cairo city. In Egypt, due to strong demographic pressure, immense construction projects are flourishing, in which our businesses must be supported. As competition rages with Chinese, American, and Arab groups, it is important that European companies play a leading role in the country. At the heart of the emergence of a multipolar world, the European Union must support the intensification of its relations with its historical partners. While this parliamentary term has been marked by several resolutions, which were particularly ill-received by the Egyptian Parliament and numerous associations, I can only express my delight at concluding this final plenary session with good news for our relations with Egypt.\n",

This agreement with Egypt is problematic from several perspectives. Firstly, because it is once again merely a press statement and not an international agreement with the EU. The complete disregard for the European Parliament and, not least, its budgetary function, has evidently become standard practice for the Commission. Secondly, this agreement is potentially controversial, as it evidently has no legal force whatsoever, nor does it contain any safeguards regarding the respect for human rights. It is impossible to escape the impression that the Union is once again unconditionally financing an autocrat. Egypt is certainly a strategically extremely important country, also for Europe. But the Commission must cease such practices. We are aware of the challenges that Egypt is facing. And it is only right that Europe also helps its partners. But we must ask ourselves whether Europe is part of the solution or part of the problem. And at whose expense it concludes such agreements and who it might potentially harm. It would be unacceptable for Europe, without adequate safeguards, to contribute in any way to the violation of human rights and the suppression of democracy and the rule of law.

A full 200 million will be used to halt migrant departures, further externalising the control of European borders and ignoring human rights. This agreement was not only signed bypassing the scrutiny of the European Parliament, but it completely ignores the grave rule of law situation in Egypt. Indeed, cooperation with this country cannot be separated from our demand for human rights to be respected, by guaranteeing freedom of expression, releasing arbitrarily detained persons, and ending the repression of minorities. This was reminded to us just in these days, here in the European Parliament, by the presence of Patrick Zaki, detained for months by the Egyptian regime and now finally free, who told us: \"If I am here, it is because you too, in these chambers, believed that fighting for my freedom was a battle to be won.\" Giulio Regeni's parents also ask this of us, he who died more than eight years ago in Egypt and for whom we are still seeking the truth. A truth that the Egyptian authorities continue to cover up and which the Italian government and European authorities should demand with much greater force. Indeed, yes, fighting for freedom and for truth is a battle to be won. And as Europe, we must continue to do so. Certainly, the European Parliament must prevent this type of commitment from being hampered by agreements lacking monitoring and transparency, carried out by governments in an utterly unacceptable manner.\n",

These are three minutes in which some government in Europe will still be thinking about either sending support or a device for defence to Ukraine. Three minutes in which some broken Ukrainian family will be trying to cross the European border in order to seek security and peace.

What we need is a European Marshall Plan, a long—term mechanism which will recover and rebuild Ukraine after this horrible war that is going on there. I think this is the chance for Europe to not only show solidarity, but for European companies to rebuild Ukraine. And we will bring it back to a path of prosperity, peace and cooperation with the European Union – something that we should have been doing over the last 15 years at least.

But they also need our financial support. That is why it is so important that we adopt the proposal today. Furthermore, I have a request for the Commission, or rather, a call upon the Commission: The refugees will not be able to return in a few days or weeks.

Unfortunately, we have seen civilians executed, women and children killed. The images from this weekend have, I believe, left their mark on all of us. We cannot turn back time to try and save them, but we can try to provide all the help they need to those who have reached us, in the countries of the European Union. Civil society has mobilised exemplarily in all states neighbouring Ukraine, but also in the states that refugees have transited or in which they have decided to stop, until the war ends. However, there is still a need for intervention from the authorities, for public support from funds that do not require the efforts of European citizens, citizens who have not yet recovered from the economic crisis and who have also been impacted by the energy crisis. We therefore understand very well that the funds made available to Member States need to be accessed as quickly and as easily as possible. And together with my colleagues from the Committee on Regional Development, I have supported this procedure. We also understand the immediate need to make their use more flexible and, especially, to increase the pre-financing rate, so that authorities have immediate access to these sums of money. However, it must be emphasised that these are European funds and, as such, must be verified and audited, just like all funds available to Member States. Even if we are in crisis situations, the European Parliament must have a say. We must be able to do our duty. Each European institution must exercise the role assigned to it by the treaties. Decisions taken bilaterally by the European Commission and the European Council must be the exception, resorted to only in extreme situations, because we, the institutions of the European Union, are the first to respect the levers of power, the system of checks and balances, as a sine qua non condition of democracy. We will have to find together, Commissioner, a way to oversee the use of funds under CARE and CARE+ to assure our citizens that all these funds have been used respecting both the letter and the spirit of the European regulations.

This mechanism will allow the mobilisation of available funds via React-EU to help the Member States hosting the most refugees fleeing the war. In the future too, we must rise to the challenge; the European Union must welcome refugees, not only Ukrainians, but all those who seek refuge in the European Union.

This figure is unfortunately set to increase in the coming weeks, given the prolonged nature of the conflict. This is an emergency that primarily concerns women and children and which has seen a great demonstration of welcome, particularly from certain states that are often instrumentally demonized even in this very Chamber, and I refer to Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, and Moldova. Indeed, several Member States are subjected to a high number of arrivals relative to the size of their population and a considerable organizational and economic effort, in the form of accommodation, social services, and transport. For this reason, our group, while aware that these resources may not be sufficient and may require further interventions in the coming weeks, as it previously did with the CARE package, strongly supports and has supported this measure and this procedure, considering them fundamental to increasing the pre-financing of REACT-EU to support Member States, but above all to continue demonstrating our closeness to the Ukrainian people. Once again, cohesion policy, as was already the case with the pandemic, proves to be the most effective and flexible policy with which to tackle emergencies and provide support to various Member States. And it is precisely because of this capacity that, I believe, a broader reflection is necessary, because it is clear that we need to build a structural solution to prevent these resources from continuing to be used in an extraordinary manner. An urgent structural solution that the Commission has a duty to find to be able to guarantee, in the face of a problem that will not be resolved in a few days or a few months, a constant solution and response.

Some initially use their 90-day tourist visa because they have not yet given up hope that the war, which derailed their entire lives, will soon be stopped. Yes, the application of the EU's Mass Influx Directive was a historic step, because the EU has finally decided to end the sell-off of its fundamental values. But it must also be said at this point: human rights are indivisible. This swift action would have been just as possible for people from the wars in Syria or Afghanistan. We should not so quickly forgive ourselves for needing the shock of the war in our neighbourhood to make us move faster. The compass of Europeans has finally settled back on solidarity. Now, many are once again experiencing what truly matters when people flee from bombs, repression, and persecution. It's about emergency accommodation, housing, jobs, immediate access to social benefits, linguistic support and integration, psychological services, and medical care – starting with vaccinations, because the pandemic has not disappeared. And last but not least: childcare and schooling bring a piece of peaceful everyday life back, especially for children and young people. However, in urban areas, housing is often lacking, while in rural areas, internet for learning is missing. And currently, energy and food prices are rising. To stabilize an infrastructure for accommodation and provision, CARE+, which we are deciding on today, is the best aid package. It simplifies procedures and releases funds. We have moved at lightning speed in this regard. And I wish that we would not understand this type of policy as a crisis mode, because there is no reasonable justification for the EU's austerity policy that has plagued us since 2008. Instead of constantly holding up the mirror of political incapacity to ourselves, we should permanently invest in solidarity. A migration-friendly infrastructure is the backbone of our democracy.

And, colleagues, humanitarian assistance is not a crime, it is an international obligation. This criminalisation is a dangerous tendency in Europe, fuelled by the lack of an adequate response by the Commission and the Council. Criminalisation is not only illegal, but it also deters people from offering life-saving assistance. And I therefore urge you, on behalf of the Greens/EFA Group, to hold a plenary debate titled ‘Criminalisation of humanitarian assistance, including search and rescue’.\n",

      "\tMadam President, Tineke Strik mentioned Greece and Italy, we all seen the court cases in Greece. The accused have been acquitted. The courts have been closed. So, if the Greens want to compliment Greece on the independence of the judiciary there, they can do so in a press release, but not through a debate. We could even do a press release together if you would like. But the EPP is always ready to debate migration, because there are plenty of reasons to do so: 330 000 illegal border crossings in 2022, more than 136% increase in the Western Balkans, with over 100 000 asylum applications per month, the highest numbers since 2016. We should debate these alarming numbers, but that is, unfortunately, not the focus of this debate. And we cannot ever only debate NGOs, humanitarian aspects and search and rescues and ignore all the rest. So, this Parliament wants a holistic approach to migration. Let us also debate holistically. The search and rescue contact group will be reconvened this month. Next month we will have the special EU summit on migration. So instead of this rushed debate this week, let us have a deeper, a wider and more comprehensive debate next month in our plenary on migration. (Parliament approved the request) Therefore the Commission statement will be added and the sitting will be extended to 23:00.\n",

      "\tMadam President, the EPP has decided to withdraw from a debate on the urgencies and negotiations. But after a meeting of the Conference of Presidents, an agreement was reached on all the urgencies: the procedure will go through your office to check that the rule of 500 words is being respected. We understand that we reached the agreement on this issue, but unfortunately we have not tabled our proposals for these plenary sessions. And it’s quite sad and strange that, as a rapporteur for Azerbaijan who is preparing a report that will be voted in AFET in forthcoming sessions, we will reduce the serious issue of the Lachin corridor only to 500 words. And I think it’s these urgencies that will be debated and discussed this session. I ask all our colleagues to be a bit more serious about the issue and ask for a full debate. I do not know if this can be changed, but this issue requires a full debate at these plenary sessions because the humanitarian situation there is dire.\n",

      "\tMadam President, under Rule 152 I am requesting that the EU—PNR Directive, which is legally and technically ready, be voted this week. This request and a possible roll call vote today is not about the merits of PNR; those have been debated. Today is simply about giving this House its right to vote without an undue delay. Some in this House talk a lot about democracy and transparency, but at the end of the day this Parliament loses credibility with the backroom deals of a few who try to manipulate our agenda to further their own political aims and priorities. The public loses faith in politics because of games, tactics and vested interests. We are a democracy; if you do not like something you vote against it and then you justify that to your electorate. You do not delay or stop it from being voted at all. My request is simple: please give me my right as rapporteur and elected Member, representing my constituents, to have a vote on this directive this week. I agree with the proposal that there should be a debate at 8.30 tomorrow morning and a vote later this week.\n",

      "\tMadam President, the security of the European Union is seriously compromised by the most insane form of terrorism we have ever known. Thousands of European citizens participate in these attacks, most often going to the Middle East for training and returning home. Over the past ten years, hundreds of Europeans have fallen into these conditions. There is general agreement that it is by developing a common European air passenger file that we will be able to trace their movements as best as possible and prevent future attacks. We worked there for three years. On such a sensitive subject, the 28 governments agreed and our competent committee, which worked extensively on this agreement, itself gave its approval. This agreement balances the requirements of security and the requirements of safeguarding individual freedoms. Some of our colleagues had hoped that the negotiation on the regulation relating to the protection of personal data would be advanced at the same time. This prerequisite is now lifted. In the meantime, new massacres took place in Paris and, since then, the threat has continued to worsen with migratory chaos. Under these conditions, a real speed race is underway between terrorists and our democracies. We can no longer put forward procedural quibbles to delay our decision. As the rapporteur said, it is now that each group, each MEP must take their responsibilities and, publicly vis-à-vis European citizens, say what priority they give or do not give to the fight against the most barbaric form of terrorism.\n",

      "\tMadam President, in general terms I appreciate Mr. Lamassoure's arguments, but I believe that the concept of \"procedural tricks\" does not correspond to the position of those of us who consider that this matter cannot be separated from data protection. I would like to point out that this is not just a question of the position of one political group or another, but that there has been, for months, a fairly established consensus in the European Parliament on the convenience of providing instruments for security but also for the protection of personal privacy. And, therefore, our position has not simply been strategic, of preserving one issue so that the other is also approved, but it is a question of values. And that is why, when Mr Kirkhope pointed out that European citizens expect us to provide them with security, an important part of this Parliament has to say that they also expect us to protect their privacy, and for that reason we are not against that the PNR be approved: we are in favor of it being approved at the same time as data protection, because it is the balance we need to preserve security and freedom.

      "\tDear Madam President, dear colleagues! The European Union's policy on Turkey in recent years has been short-sighted, to say the least, and it took tens of thousands of refugees to remind us how important this country is to the European Union. But we are now again in danger of adopting a really short-sighted policy towards Turkey. It's not that we're against seeking an understanding with the refugees - that's how it has to be. But we as the Green Party consider it completely irresponsible if we now enter a new phase of negotiations and ignore the internal escalation in Turkey and the abandonment of any rule of law. The violent – one has to say – occupation and takeover of Turkey's largest daily newspaper last weekend and actually immediately before the summit in Brussels cannot be accepted. We must discuss this in this House, we must discuss this with Mrs Mogherini. Nor can it be accepted that the escalation in southeast Turkey continues completely undeterred. There are two sides involved. But this spiral of escalation must end. What Kati Piri, Knut Fleckenstein and others, including my colleagues, have reported from the southeast is completely unacceptable. Since there is now repeated talk on the sidelines of the summit about recognizing Turkey as a safe third country, I ask you: Can we allow this without debate? What we are seeing already shows that many Turkish citizens will need political asylum in the near future if we do not explicitly try to address this from our side. I ask you to support our request not to simply discuss these issues within the summit, but to expressly discuss these issues in the perspective of the newly launched negotiation initiative with Turkey.\n",

      "\tMadam President, I rise to support Mrs Harms' proposal. I returned from Türkiye yesterday. The testimonies we received there are overwhelming. It is true that journalists are persecuted: at least 67 journalists, according to government sources, including those from Zaman, the main opposition newspaper put under supervision, which reappeared yesterday curiously displaying a pro-government line, but also journalists from Cumhuriyet, another opposition newspaper. We visited the Armutlu district, the main Alevi district of the city of Istanbul, where we met the family of young Dilek Dogan, who was coldly murdered by the police as she returned to her apartment. There are also the academics: 300 have just been indicted for terrorism for the sole reason that they had denounced the situation in the South-East. Precisely the South-East, where there are more than 768 Kurds who have been murdered since July, including 98 children and 87 women – terrorists undoubtedly! 255 just in Cizre in conditions which are unbearable, which are even unworthy of the international law of war. We all fear that this will happen again in Sur, the historic capital, the historic old town, where the main Armenian church in the region is located. We therefore call for a debate and we think it is time to have one on the human rights situation in Turkey.\n",

      "\tMadam President, we are very concerned about the situation of the press in Turkey and the crazy agitation in universities. But we do not consider it necessary to have a separate debate tomorrow, as the Green group is proposing. The reason is very simple: Wednesday morning, if you look at the agenda, we have in the program a debate on Turkey, and in particular on today's meeting between the 28 heads of state or government and the Prime Minister. Turkish minister. Moreover, the President of our Parliament has just sent us, around thirty minutes ago, a note explaining that the question of Zaman in particular has already been raised by himself and by the representatives of the Member States.

      "\tAs a group, we have requested that the item on the situation in Kazakhstan be postponed to the April part-session during the emergency debate on Thursday and instead include a debate and a resolution on the violations of human rights obligations in the context of the forced evacuation of the Calais jungle. You all know that numerous accommodations in the Calais refugee camp have been forcibly evacuated since last week. Volunteers and NGOs on the ground have also reported that there has been a high level of violence by French security forces as they have taken people out of their homes, despite assurances that the approach would be gradual and gradual I will refrain from using force. That's exactly why we want to have this debate here. We know that many people are desperate. You have probably also seen the pictures of people having their mouths sewn shut as a protest against the forced eviction. I think it would be important for us as a Parliament to agree on this. Finally, a remark: There was always something like a rumor here that there was a gentlemen's agreement that no human rights violations within the European Union should be discussed in the emergency debate, but that there had to be special agenda items for this. I would like to speak to the President of Parliament, who has stated that human rights violations cannot be classified geographically. And if we have a special agenda item that involves human rights violations, then we should have an open ear and clear eyes for it, especially when human rights violations within the EU need to be addressed, and we should do that here too.\n",

      "\tMadam President, I am very grateful to Ms Zimmer for suggesting this because I think it is indeed essential that we take very seriously violations of human rights in our own continent and I believe that is exactly what is happening in the Calais camp. I visited there myself quite recently and I was really shocked to see the way the British and French Governments were not taking seriously the needs of the asylum seekers who were there. We believe very strongly that the British Government should be registering refugees in that camp and should not be relying on the fact that Britain is outside Schengen and that they cannot reach Britain to register. We believe a lot of the refugees there actually have rights to come and be reunited with their families in Britain under the Dublin Agreement and my government is simply not taking those rights seriously. I believe that the destruction of their homes is actually a violation of their right to shelter under the UN Convention on Human Rights and I think it is very essential that as a parliament we take seriously these violations of human rights within our own continent, so I entirely support the proposal that we should debate this as one of the urgencies.\n",

Secondly, the enforced closure of part of the migrant camp, the Jungle, was on the basis of a French decision taken in a French law court. We have no right whatsoever to interfere with French judicial process. The third item – and I would like to ask everyone to take this into consideration – is that one of the many reasons why the migrants reacted as they did was one anarchist supported by a British charity, and I do not think we ought to support anarchists’ and activists’ work. The last point is that a lot of these migrants do not want their fingerprints to be taken. That was another reason why they reacted with the violence they did. There is absolutely no way this Chamber should take any stance on this position. It is down to a situation between the UK and French Governments. (Parliament rejected the request)\n",

The only exception will be travel for the purpose of performing paid work, for which a work visa will still be required.

The list of countries whose citizens can travel to the EU without a visa is included in the Annex to Regulation No. 539/2001, and until now the visa-free regime was usually introduced by amending this Annex. Considering that some member states may already have concluded bilateral agreements on visa-free travel from an earlier period, and these agreements may make it difficult to implement the basic rule allowing stays in the Schengen area for only 90 days in every 180 days, it was decided to conclude as part of the introduction of visa-free relations with third countries, EU visa-free agreements, which will clearly replace national visa-free agreements and reflect the 90 in 180 rule.\n",

One of the important areas of collaboration is that of visa-free travel for short periods of stay. Those periods refer, in particular, to tourist stays or business trips. The elimination of the visa regime constitutes a significant boost for the development of the tourism field. The Pacific area is a developing region that benefits from excellent natural conditions for tourism activities at any time of the year. Eliminating the need for visas for European citizens would facilitate organizational efforts and increase the number of European tourists in the states of the region, with significant effects for the respective states' economies. The benefits would be mutual, allowing our citizens easier access to vacations in this region of the world.

Many of us hope that new chapters in negotiations will be opened so that both Serbia and other Balkan countries will soon become members. The problem is that you falter. There is still an idea that Serbia can have two mothers, both the EU and Russia, because while Serbia is reaching out to the EU, it has not followed the EU's foreign policy towards Russia. They have allowed Russia to dominate Serbia's energy market and thus exposed themselves to future pressures. It is preparing a joint military exercise with Russia and supports the statements aimed at dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina. Therefore, it feels important to add to the report an encouragement to Serbia to continue on the chosen path of rapprochement with the EU. That is where Serbia's future lies. Likewise, it feels important to encourage the Commission to help Serbia be able to detach itself from Russia. Serbia can be the EU's bridge to Russia, but then it must first be part of the EU.

The progress report on Serbia focuses on the rule of law, democracy, human rights, respect for minorities, regional cooperation and energy, the environment and transport. While Serbia has made a lot of ambitious reforms and opened chapters on financial control and normalisation of relations between Serbia and Kosovo, which in particular is an important condition for Serbia’s accession to the EU, there are areas which must still be improved. Although steps have been taken to form an independent judiciary, political interference remains high. The issue of corruption and organised crime also remains worrying. Progress has been made with a whistleblower protection law but corruption, including at the highest levels, must be pursued and an action plan for an anti-corruption strategy fully implemented. Hopefully these issues will be addressed in the submitted action plan for a Chapter on Judiciary and fundamental rights. Finally, regarding freedom of expression and the media, no progress has been made on this democratic cornerstone. Continuous political pressure undermines media independence, with journalists threatened and intimidated. This is a crucial outstanding issue and must be rectified for Serbia to progress.\n",

Well beyond the evaluation of the process, the resolution points to a vast set of conditions with a view to accession, which confirm the extent of the interference and loss of sovereignty imposed on countries and peoples in the EU accession process. Consider reforms in the judicial and political system, Serbia's recognition of the existence of Kosovo, labor reforms, privatizations, restructuring of the public sector, protection of private investment, budgetary reform, impositions under the functioning of institutions, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The successive enlargements of the EU have allowed large economic and financial groups to expand the Community internal market, allowing them to dominate new economies, creating new opportunities for the exploitation of a qualified, low-cost workforce. The lordly stance with which the considerations and conditions required to satisfy the precepts relating to the country's integration are presented is unacceptable, depriving the people of their legitimate right to decide their future, which includes the free and sovereign choice of joining the EU, but also economic and social development strategies.

I believe that the European Commission, which has the duty to protect the rule of law, should play an important role in this. The rapporteur accepted most of the amendments that I submitted with my colleagues from the Croatian EPP delegation, where I particularly emphasize the issue of the status of the Croatian national minority in Vojvodina and the problem of missing persons. I am also satisfied because our colleagues in the European Parliament have begun to understand how problematic the Law on the Organization and Jurisdiction of State Bodies in War Crimes Proceedings is, by which Serbia abuses the principle of universal jurisdiction, as evidenced by the amendment of the author of the resolution itself, which was adopted today, and by which this the issue became international. In the case of Serbia, the European Commission can no longer push problems under the carpet, but must start solving them.

I support the contents of the motion, which encourages Serbia to prepare a separate action plan for the situation of national minorities. The settlement of the minority situation in the Western Balkans is not necessary because of the European Union, it cannot be a mandatory task to be carried out as a result of external pressure, but must be an expression of an internal demand that can steer the processes in the direction of normality.

      "\tMadam President, dear Evelyn, congratulations from me on becoming Vice President, dear colleagues! Dear Commissioner, I'm going to ask you two simple questions tonight, and I think you'd actually like to answer no to these simple questions. But I ask the first question: Is this German car toll compliant with EU law? At this point I would also like to quote a proven expert on these questions, who said: A road user fee is only compliant with EU law if it does not discriminate on the basis of nationality. It's not me saying that, it's what you said, Commissioner Bulc, at the start of the infringement procedure in June 2015. Accordingly, let us start from this principle. Has this discrimination now been eliminated through the supposed agreement? Not in my opinion. As before, EU foreigners are still burdened more heavily than German citizens. Or simply put: A Belgian driver with a Euro 6 car pays the toll, a German driver does not. Hence the answer to the first question “Is the new German toll model compliant with EU law?”: No, it is not. I come to the second question: Is this toll a symbol of good European cooperation? Here too the answer: No, it is not. There is currently no European toll system. This toll violates the fundamental principles of our Union, which you and the Commission must protect. There should not be the feeling that our European partners are financing Germany's roads at the expense of their neighbors. Because then what would be the result? The long-term consequence would be that we would undermine the basic principles of the internal market and coexistence in Europe. That's why this toll must have no place in Europe, especially not in our time when so many doubt the EU. Ms. Bulc, you have it in your hands. The process is currently on hold. Therefore, an urgent appeal to you: continue the infringement procedure, otherwise Member States will sue. And have no doubt: this idea is gaining more and more support because it is about more than just tolls, it is about the fundamental principles of our European Union.\n",

Firstly, the Commission seems to have problems applying the same standards to large Member States as to small ones. As a reminder: In Europe it is still really the strength of the law and not the law of the strongest that counts. Secondly: After the submission to the Bundestag, Commission President Juncker personally announced in May 2015 that the toll would be examined due to significant doubts regarding European law. In September 2016 the Commission decided to refer Germany to the European Court of Justice and on 3 An agreement was then surprisingly announced in November. Commissioner, what has changed? I still pay more for the same car on the same route just because I have an Austrian license plate, regardless of the emissions class. Discrimination is still discrimination. Thirdly: Although Transport Minister Dobrindt deserves another European thistle in his collection, I would also like to take a stand for the German approach. If there is a European solution as part of the revision of the Eurovignette Directive, then national taxes must go down. But if – as in the present case – only the neighboring countries should bear the burden for German taxpayers, then that is not acceptable. The Commission is called upon to take a closer look. Cross-border mobility should not and must not be punished. Drivers, regardless of nationality, are not fair game for finance ministers and populists – see Article 18. I hope the Commission will reconsider its position.\n",

But you now have to represent what was ultimately agreed at a higher level - between Mr. Juncker and Ms. Merkel - in order to smoke a peace pipe within the federal government, within the CDU and the CSU, and at least in one problematic area, namely the foreigner toll to put away. Nevertheless, dear Commissioner, the questions that Mrs Schmidt just asked are still on the table. I would like to recall that we spoke to each other repeatedly at the beginning of this period, when this proposal was on the table. We have discussed all of these components and ultimately they still do not contribute to making the whole thing, which started as a foreigners' toll on the part of the CSU, ultimately compliant with European law. It is still the case that you have just admitted that there will not be one-to-one compensation for German drivers. And you continue to admit that it ultimately has to conform to the user and polluter principle. So I ask myself: Where does this proposal correspond to this user and polluter principle? And I would also like to ask you, Commissioner: What did the European Commission get in return? Is it true that the European Commission has thereby bought, or at least bought, the Federal Republic of Germany's consent to the EETS legislation? Is that right? Yes or no? And also, say quite openly: Why did this statement or at least this deal ultimately take place exactly in the week in which the CSU party conference took place in Bavaria?

I think we all understand that there could be only three reasons why the Commission put the infringement procedure on hold. Initially, you said, Commissioner, that it would be better to negotiate with the German Government before the measure became law; now, when it has become law, you are waiting to think what to do. I think there is a contradiction in that statement. Other possible reasons could be that the Commission made legal mistakes when it started infringement proceedings – and if that is not the case, I would like more information about the changes – or that the German Government has made enough political statements to remove discrimination against car owners from other countries and drivers of environment-friendly cars?

This is an article from Lower Saxony and the Netherlands in the border area together. The fact is that our state government – I come from this part of Germany – is completely against introducing this toll. The fact is: we have a Euregio region right in the border area with the Netherlands. It was deliberately set up to have cross-border traffic and work. There are many people who live in the Netherlands and work in Lower Saxony. There are more jobs here in Lower Saxony, so there are more people there who can fill the jobs. This is massively undermined. There is not enough public transport, you have to rely on the car and that means only some people pay and others don't. It is also the case that thanks to the German toll, if you have an environmentally friendly car - which in principle is not a bad thing, Euro 6 - you can even earn money from the toll. Mr. Dobrindt still says today: The Germans no longer pay. That means: Who pays for it then? The question is, of course, from a German perspective: Is there even enough income? Isn't this perhaps a zero-sum game? But we have to discuss this in Germany. In general, I actually think that this principle user pays, polluter pays is of course good. It would be best if we had no car tax at all, everywhere in all European countries, and you only pay whenever you drive. That would be the fairest and best thing. Of course, that's not possible at the moment because we can't simply say: everyone has to abolish vehicle tax. But what we have on the table now is actually not a good blueprint. Last thing: It's not mileage-based either, it's not like you pay for every mile. There are still different sections – month and so on. That's not what we need and it's far too bureaucratic.\n",

However, I firmly believe that we must demand from the German side – and I am asking you to do it not only in the form of words, but concrete actions on the part of the Commission – so that it does not do so in a way that is discriminatory towards drivers from other member countries. I consider the German toll concept to be discriminatory because it means that all Germans will be reimbursed to a large extent and only foreigners will de facto pay the tolls.

As early as 1990, the then Transport Minister Zimmermann wanted to implement the truck toll and reduce the vehicle tax for trucks. Did the Commission say no? In 1992 the European Court of Justice said: This is anti-European. With that it was buried. In 2004, the then federal government wanted to try the same thing. The Commission said again: This is anti-European. It was then introduced anyway. Now Alexander Dobrindt comes with his third attempt. I always say: mistakes make you wise. But for Alexander Dobrindt two weren't enough. Why is it so? The toll is anti-European; it prevents cross-border traffic. It costs. Only foreigners pay – not Germans. That doesn't work. In addition, the vignette is unecological and anti-social because someone who drives 10,000 kilometers a year pays exactly as much as someone who drives 200,000 kilometers. That has nothing at all to do with the user and polluter pays principle. That's why it has to be stopped, and I can't understand why the Commission initially said: This is anti-European, and then, after Juncker met with the CSU in Bavaria - passing by the Commissioner, by the way - that everything should then be legal . That doesn't work. The Bundestag still has to decide on it. But if he decides to do that, then I think, because it's anti-social, then not only the SPD but also the CSU would have to delete the S in their name, because that's totally anti-social.\n",

We in the PPE do not oppose charging tolls, just as we do not want tolls in the Netherlands, that must be clear. But compensation for only German citizens leads to discrimination and is contrary to European law.

In the European Parliament we have succeeded in bringing forward a cross-national and cross-party resolution that aims to respect the principle of non-discrimination and strengthen political cooperation in Europe.

It is difficult to understand the behavior of the Commission, which, despite the first appropriate reaction, suspended the procedure for clarifying objections to the compliance of this idea with European law, although the main objection is still valid.

And now about the alleged discrimination. I cannot recognize this, and the Commissioner rightly stated it: every user of our German motorways should pay in the future, and I emphasize: every user - regardless of their nationality. The question of tax was also raised. Reducing vehicle tax is a matter for the Member States. In Austria there is also a commuter allowance. There is also a tax break for drivers driving in Austria.

According to the established jurisprudence of the Court of Justice, restrictions on the freedoms of the internal market are impermissible, not only those that are discriminatory, but even those that make the use of the freedoms of the internal market less attractive if they are disproportionate.

Europe does not come to life here in the European Parliament, but locally, where people live together across national borders. The toll plans of the German CSU transport minister are making Europe more unfair and less open. Like most of my colleagues, I reject this out of conviction. For the people of the border region, driving across the border by car is the most normal thing in the world. Cross-border networks in this region, such as the Ems-Dollart region or the Euregio, show the deep interconnectedness of German-Dutch relations. My constituency benefits enormously from a Europe of freedom of movement and non-discriminatory road use between the Netherlands and Germany. I think the toll is a brake on the economy because it makes it less attractive to drive across the border, go shopping or go on a weekend trip. Jobs will also suffer from the toll, and it discriminates against foreigners in contrast to German citizens - even if her colleague from the CSU doesn't see it that way.\n",

Otherwise, we cannot trust them to act responsibly with the human aid that we provide. We have to continue to express our support for Afghan women and girls. We have to give them the hope and we have to fight for their future. This is why, together with my colleagues, we put forward a proposal for the 2023 EU budget to provide funding to the Afghan online university. We believe it is important that Afghans in Afghanistan and abroad in refugee camps continue with their education despite poverty and oppression.\n",

      "\tMadam Chair, all eyes are on the Russian aggression, and rightly so. But let us not make the mistake we make so often of jumping from crisis to crisis and forgetting about the rest of the world. Just last summer, our anger and frustration were targeted at the Taliban takeover, which has turned Afghan lives into absolute hell. The Taliban is showing its real face as a brutal oppressor and a jailer of women and girls. More than 4 million girls are stuck at home, while women are deprived of their right to work, to study and to travel freely. Girls face forced marriages. And formal official or government members, journalists, human rights defenders and minorities are attacked, detained and killed. We must prioritise their human rights by making tough demands towards the Taliban, by reaching out to protect them. The Taliban takeover has also made the lives of all Afghan people extremely dire. More than 24 million people depend on humanitarian aid, and the drought, pandemic and the freezing of international aid have deepened this crisis. The Russian invasion has even increased food insecurity due to skyrocketing grain prices. We must ensure that sanctions effectively target the Taliban, without undermining the basic socioeconomic rights of the poor Afghan people, by creating alternative ways to reach them and by stepping up humanitarian aid. Because if we do not act now, we risk more people dying from the humanitarian crisis in the country than from the last 20 years of conflict. Many people are at immediate risk of persecution in Afghanistan, and they need our support to leave the country and be protected elsewhere. I call upon the High Representative and the Commission to step up the coordination for evacuation and to press Member States to enhance their visa and resettlement policies. We must invest in the better protection of refugees in neighbouring countries. But let’s be fair: there is a clear need for safe passage to our embassies and the European Union as well. Let us make sure that Afghan refugees are welcomed and protected, not pushed back and let down. Our solidarity with the Ukrainian refugees has shown that we are able to do it. Every refugee has the same needs and the same rights. The Afghans need and deserve our support now.\n",

And here we are, the EU Parliament once again virtue—signalling and being appalled by the way women are treated in Afghanistan. But instead of clearly identifying the cause of this dehumanising treatment of Afghan women, politicians like Sawsan Chebli deal Afghan women yet another blow by insisting their systematic denial of human rights had nothing to do with Islam and putting the blame on men in general. No, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why women in Afghanistan are treated the way they are has everything to do with Islam. For God’s sake, take a look around, there isn’t a single Muslim country in the world in which women are not victimised by the so-called religion of peace. If you truly want to improve the situation of women – and could you please make sure I get to finish my speech, President , thank you – in Afghanistan, call the devil by its name and stop using apologetic terms to downplay the true nature of the most despicable and horrific ideology women suffer from worldwide.

In Afghanistan, US sanctions currently imposed on the country, and the theft of the US of more than USD 7 billion of the country’s assets, are on track to take the lives of more civilians in the coming year than the illegal NATO war took in 20 years. Over 25 million people, 55% of the Afghan population, are facing high levels of acute food insecurity. 1 million children may starve.

This was, of course, all the crueller because we had promised this generation of Afghan women, and indeed they had expected it. They expected to have a brighter future, a future of their own making. High Representative, you referred to the heart-breaking images. Yet again, women forced away, young girls forced away from education, from institutions of learning. Why? Because a woman with an education can build a brighter future not only for herself, but for her family and for her country. And that’s what the Taliban, the all-male leadership are afraid of – because they don’t want a brighter future for Afghanistan, its women and children. They want a subjugated people they can control. Afghanistan will never be free until we let girls learn. So if the Taliban don’t do it for us, we must help Afghan women and girls build their country’s brighter future.

And it’s especially the women that suffer under the Taliban regime. They cannot work. They now cannot even go to secondary school. They are banned from public and restricted to their homes. The Taliban deny them all their human rights. Journalists, lawyers, activists, fighting for these women, are silenced with abuse and terror.

Afghanistan, with its immense and arid mountains, with its turbaned men with piercing gazes, and with its endless poppy fields. We have grown up or grown old with Afghanistan at war, with the USSR, with Bernard Kouchner, with Commander Massoud and the Taliban on television, and then, this summer, with the Americans who fled this land of war overnight. This sudden return to customs of another era reminds us of our inability to implant women's rights in distant societies where many fundamentally reject our way of life. What did the Americans do there for all these years? Did they truly believe that by changing the regime, they could change Afghan society as a whole? They left Afghanistan in ruins. They left this country in the hands of the Taliban. 'When houses were locked from the inside, American soldiers would batter them down with battering rams, forcibly removing women's veils,' wrote Emmanuel Razavi, a veteran reporter, this summer. So, I think of all these Afghan women who, ultimately, are paying for our arrogance in believing that we can impose our way of life on the entire planet. It is our collective failure. 2 trillion dollars were invested in Afghanistan by the United States over the last 20 years, with 500 billion of that used to pay the interest on the debt. France lost 90 soldiers and had 700 wounded there. Who knows if 1 trillion more euros could change this country? Who knows if another 1000 amputee soldiers could change this country? I see that some colleagues are organising a flashmob tomorrow in solidarity with these Afghan women. Do you really think a flashmob will change this country? The urgency is to manage these millions of refugees arriving here in Europe, especially with these men who come with their customs from another century and who try to impose them on our daughters, our sisters, our mothers, and even on these Afghan women refugees.

And in Afghanistan, women should have the opportunity, girls should have the opportunity, to attend school.

Yes, we must advocate for women's rights in Afghanistan, but we must not increase pressure on the Taliban at the expense of the people in Afghanistan. It does the women and girls no good if they are deprived of their rights by the Taliban and then have to starve as a result. Therefore, we must also review sanctions and, for example, work towards ensuring that the central bank can pay salaries again. Yes, so there is a need for better support on the ground, but there is also a need for escape routes for people who can no longer stay there.

Our initial shock here in the EU at how rapidly the Taliban seized control has passed. But this atmosphere of desperation and fear in Afghanistan has not. The Taliban made many empty promises after their takeover that they would offer full amnesty to Afghans who worked for the Western—backed government and uphold women’s rights. No sooner were these promises made than they were broken. I’m in contact with an Afghan woman and her family who tell me of their precarious situation with their rights and freedoms severely restricted and living in isolation. On 23 March, a glimmer of hope was soon extinguished when the Taliban ordered girls secondary schools to shut just hours after they had reopened for the first time. Many students were crying as they were turned away from their classes. As a former teacher, I am horrified by this denial of education and, by extension, denial of a future. The international community must increase its pressure on the Taliban to ensure that not only are girls allowed to return to school as soon as possible, but also that the curriculum will provide them with a genuine education. This will be hugely important step, and just one of the many steps needed to improve the situation of women and girls in Afghanistan.\n",

A prison, yes, because it is no longer possible to leave that country! As I recalled, there is a ban on leaving the country without being accompanied.

The zero-degree of politics is these leaders who, on the one hand, underestimate human beings – and above all women – to the point of nullifying them, and, on the other hand, cling to their seats on the United Nations Human Rights Commission.

The European Union will be strong if it will be based on those values without compromises, if it will be based on those values not only here in the European Parliament or in some other EU institutions, but also on a national, regional and local level. This is the only way how those values can be established also on the whole European continent. Why is it so important to talk about those basic principles and values? Because this is the only way how sustainable peace can be established on the European continent, since there is a very well—known law of geopolitics: only democracies are not fighting with each other. That is why defence of those values everywhere in our Union and the spread of democracy and basic human values into the eastern side of European continent is the most important strategic geopolitical goal for all of us, and especially during this war. We need to recognise, all of us in the European Union: we are not perfect back home in this area. There are things which we need to improve and to strengthen, also in Lithuania. But today I want to elaborate on what our President was speaking about. What should our common strategic agenda be in order to assist the nations in the eastern part of the European continent to enjoy the same European values of democracy and human rights? I want to repeat: sustainable peace on European continent will be established only when Belarusian and Russian people will have a possibility to enjoy those values and to live in normal European conditions. Such a strategic agenda will be implemented only if we shall proceed with a very clear strategic action plan. First, Ukraine needs to decisively defeat Putin’s Russia during this year, and that will create possibilities for big political changes in Russia and Belarus. Our most important obligation: weapons, weapons, weapons… and sanctions. Second, the absolute geopolitical priority for you during this year: to start membership negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova. That would be the most powerful European geopolitical answer to Kremlin hybrid offensive activities in the region, especially in Moldova and perhaps also in Georgia. Third, the integration of Ukraine, Moldova and possibly Georgia towards the EU should be concluded till the end of this decade, since that is the only way how successful and prosperous democracies can be created in those countries. The success of those countries would be an inspiration for Belarusian and Russian societies to follow. Fourth, Ukraine needs to get membership in NATO, if not during the Vilnius summit this year, then during the Washington summit next year. It would help Russian people to abandon their dream to restore empire because Ukraine will be gone. Fifth, the EU needs to show clear perspective. Democratic Belarus will have possibility to integrate into the EU. Democratic Russia will have a special and very practical relationship with the EU.

Today, Ukraine is in this same position, heroically fighting for its own freedom and ours. It is fighting against the same aggressor, only with a changed name. It is therefore no surprise that from the first day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine until now, the voice of Lithuania and other Baltic States has been the loudest, urging not only the provision of urgent and comprehensive assistance to Ukraine, but also demanding a common and united European Union response to stop Russia's aggression. Here and now. Allow me to remind you that for many years, Lithuania and other Baltic States consistently spoke and warned about the true face of Russia and the objectives of its authoritarian Putin regime. Unfortunately, not all members of the European community were willing to heed these warnings. However, these warnings have become a bloody reality for the people of Ukraine. Today, everyone has acknowledged that the discourse of Lithuania and the Baltic States concerning the bloody objectives of the Kremlin regime was not merely an airing of historical grievances. We did this because we knew how fragile freedom is and how immense its price is, and we aimed to prevent this from happening again in Europe, and to ensure that no nation would ever experience brutal oppression and an assault on its territorial integrity and freedom. Never. I fully agree with our President. Historical memory must not be relegated to the archives. History must not be forgotten, and the war initiated by Putin bears witness to this once again. Therefore, I call upon us to be responsible, united, and courageous, to establish a tribunal for Russia's war crimes, to take all possible actions and impose sanctions to weaken the power of the Kremlin regime, and to help Ukraine win this brutal war, as this is also a guarantor of Europe's long-term security. We must be united in restoring and expanding our defensive capabilities – our security as Europeans will depend on how we pursue this together, jointly, and in a concerted manner. Distinguished colleagues, a strong and resilient Europe can only exist when it is united, socially responsible, just, and progressive. Our goal as socialists and democrats is to strengthen Europe's social foundation and to ensure that the objectives approved at the Porto Summit are fully implemented in all member states. A Social Europe must ensure that even those on minimal incomes can live with dignity and support their families, rather than falling into poverty; that there are no children living in poverty, of whom we still have over 18 million in Europe today; that men and women receive equal pay for the same work; that our pensioners enjoy a dignified old age; and that the rights and freedoms of all people are protected. Only a socially strong, resilient, and responsible Europe will be able to cope with challenges such as the green transition and digitalization, which will inevitably impact Europe's socio-economic model and labor market.

And it is true that only together, as Europeans, can we stand up against the brutal imperialism of the Russian regime. We have shown here in the European Parliament that we stand for unwavering solidarity with Ukraine, be it financial, humanitarian, or military support, paving the way for Ukraine to become a member of the European Union.

Nor does the shift from one fossil fuel dependency to another non-renewable energy source.

But, Mr President, the fight against authoritarianism does not only happen, unfortunately, outside of the European Union. We also have to stay vigilant inside because we can see attempts of undermining our democracy, of undermining separation of powers, rule of law and fundamental rights in the European Union, brutal attacks on press freedom and journalists. We cannot stay silent in the European Union on these developments because the EU is not only a community of trade – we share fundamental values. If we want the EU to be strong and true to its own values, we have to protect all our citizens from these attacks, no matter whether they are from Lithuania or Portugal, no matter their gender, their skin colour or their sexual orientation.

      "\tEsteemed Mr. President! Today's war in Ukraine poses a threat to international security and is the cause of an economic crisis. Lasting peace is a supreme value. Lasting peace is also essential, as is solidarity, which would allow us to survive this difficult time. However, there is a big problem today with European solidarity, because some large countries pursue their own, egoistic policies. The Union is also experiencing a crisis of values, those values that once built the Community, and from which we are unfortunately departing. I am saying this primarily to the EU institutions, where there is no development of democracy and free political thought. Unfortunately, an artificial power arrangement blocks the development of freedom, blocks in defiance of democracy, as the will of a large part of the electorate, up to 50%, is rejected. Today's arrangement unites a single goal – power at any cost and the division of \"posts\". This is a peculiar usurpation of democracy. The two main forces in this Parliament – the EPP and the Socialists – although theoretically having different programmes, have for years united immediately after elections to exclude a third force, and in this way do not have to deliver on their programmes. The Socialists promise social programmes but do not implement them. They promise to care for the poorest but support CO2 emissions trading, which causes price increases and the impoverishment of people. The EPP declares that it upholds Christian values, but does not defend life from conception to natural death, does not protect marriage understood as a union between a woman and a man, and often supports gender ideology, which has nothing to do with true Christian Democracy. Additionally, both forces impose the creation of an EU federation, which destroys the Europe of nations that it was intended to be in the vision of its founders, Schuman and others. Unfortunately, this artificial political arrangement blocks free thought and ideas. The EPP-Socialist arrangement does not allow for any alternative, the so-called third force. Such a system encourages political corruption, which we are witnessing in Parliament. This harmful and undemocratic practice is also being transferred to the level of member states. Even our President Gitanas Nausėda is being attacked, and his election challenged, although he received 67% of the votes. This is not conducive to democracy. Europe is becoming an ideological void due to the EPP and Socialist arrangement. It is in disarray. Therefore, in the name of true European solidarity, a third or fourth force is needed that will be able to heal Europe, to restore its true face based on its roots. It is precisely the ECR that is the force that recognises this and wants to change it, as we discussed recently at summits in Warsaw and Madrid. We also spoke about the need to strengthen Europe's energy independence and the development of its own industry, including heavy and defence industries. In accordance with this idea, today we would not be facing problems with our defence capabilities in an era of aggression in Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! Europe and the Union need more democracy and freedom based on Christian values, the traditional family, and free thought, because such is the true soul of Europe.\n",

      "\tMadam President, President Nausėda of Lithuania, first of all I am more than happy to be here as from one from the Baltic States, from Estonia. And I really appreciate your several statements that Latvia and Lithuania have been together in history and the good and also in the bad times If we just remind the history, it was pretty easy for Russia — they called it the Soviet Union at the time but it was Russia, the same thing — to break down each country one by one because all those three countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, had their own some kind of policy. And for Moscow, it wasn’t very hard to have some kind of deals each by each. And the result we know pretty well and it’s just experience for the history. If you try to make some kind of deals with Satan, you are the loser from the beginning, there is no chance. To remind some of the necessity of the support to Ukraine. We all agree, most of us agree here. And there is different kind of ways to help Ukraine. But the most necessary definitely is military aid. As we can see in the news, the next weeks and the next months will be very crucial in Ukraine because both sides haven’t won. And if somebody’s saying that there is no winner in the war, there is. The winner can be only Ukraine, because if they lose we will be the next ones. And there is no question about that. As I looked just on the statistics, the resources, those three Baltic states have given the biggest military and financial aid to Ukraine. Estonia with 1%, Latvia with 0.98%, Lithuania with 0.65% of the GDP. And the fourth one is Poland with 0.63%. At the same time, there has been very huge help from the US and from the UK. But they can do more. And the problem for us now is that we really don’t have a lot yet to really give to Ukraine. But there are much more to give from the US, from the UK, also from Germany and France. Germany has given 0.17% of the GDP, France 0.07% of the GDP. Those are just cold facts and numbers. And now the question is: are they really brave enough to make this change in the war or not? Because if we will lose this momentum now, in the next month, we will face the new war in the next two or three years. So just a moment to think which kind of chances we have if somebody is talking about the peace negotiations. The peace can be only if the conditions are good for us. And the only conditions that are good for us can be that there is no ambitions for Russia to start any kind of aggression in next decades. I will not say ‘forever’. We shouldn’t be very naive. Russia will not disappear. But the only thing what we can do is just to weaken them as much as possible and to show that they cannot win their neighbours. And finally, I would like to really thank you that Lithuania was one of the countries two years ago who showed how to deal with illegal migration. There is no question that if you are the war refugee, you need help. There is no doubt. But what we saw in Belarus, it was just illegal migration, what was used by Belarus for the hybrid attacks. And Lithuania, together with Poland, just shut down the border and said ‘there is no way to enter to the European countries through those countries illegally’, because if you open the border, there would be no ending, no ending at all. And you did absolutely well. So labai ačiū, thank you so much. And good luck for the Baltic cooperation.\n",

      "\tMadam President, President Nausėda, President of Lithuania, I welcome you to the European Parliament. All political groups, from the very first moment, expressed our clear, absolute condemnation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and your presence here is an opportunity to discuss the future of the European Union: What must we do to stop the European Union from ageing, from its geopolitical and economic role on the planet from weakening, and to move more effectively to address the demands and concerns of citizens. To achieve these goals, we need a European Union that is not just a common market and \"a bit of a political union\". We need a stronger Community budget, larger than 1% of European GDP, with more own resources, with more money for reducing social inequalities, which have increased, to support the poorest countries and the poorest social categories, to implement the Green Deal; a European Union that must remain a project of peace and democracy. Because democracy is suffering even within the European Union: in Poland and in Hungary, unfortunately also in my homeland Greece, and I do not think, Mr President, that you yourself are satisfied that democracy is at its best in Lithuania either. Therefore, we must respect the rule of law and avoid the risk of paralysis in the Council, where unanimity often becomes a weapon in the hands of blackmailers, of governments that block the functioning of the European Union to extort, to achieve something for their own interests. Regarding enlargement, let us be honest. Let us not promise the peoples of Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine things that require years and changes and conditions. Beware! Enlargement towards the Western Balkans was decided at the Thessaloniki Summit, in my homeland, in 2003, and 20 years later, the countries of the Western Balkans are waiting for the European Union to fulfil its commitments, and of course, they too must carry out the necessary reforms. Let us not repeat the same mistake, promising populist things that we cannot deliver tomorrow.\n",

They were occupied and they remained independent. I remember that, in 1987, our Prime Minister, from our party, Cavaco Silva – who was Prime Minister ten years and President of the Republic ten years – had a huge conflict with the Parliament because he didn’t agree with a visit to the Soviet Union, where the territories of Baltic states were included. And the government fell down because he was defending this principle. So, I have to tell you that, for decades, we were in the European Union defending the sovereignty and the future of democracy and freedom to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. And today, Mr President, we are very proud because your country became a world front runner of defence, of democracy, of freedom, of human rights. This was clear when you sent all the support to the Ukrainian people, but also when you are claiming for democracy in Belarus and when you are saying that you don’t accept the blackmail of China. The example of the Ukrainian solidarity shows that you want for other countries in Europe, and I dare say in world, the same fate that Lithuania had, which was in a very, very oppressive regime and managed to become independent and to give freedom, prosperity and human rights’ respect to all the citizens. I would like to thank you, to say ačiū, Mr President, to all the Lithuanian people and also to you and to your government.

You have my full support for the agenda you have put forward.

It is not sustainable to go to a Foreign Affairs Council with 30, 32 or 33 states with a right of veto in foreign policy, for example.

It takes courage never to turn your back on your allies. Your country has shown this courage; your people embody it. Your country has shown us what some did not want and still do not want to see: that national sovereignty is strengthened by European solidarity.

That is why, and you have mentioned it, a strong, responsive, effective anti-coercion instrument, which cannot be blocked by a Member State, is imperative. Yes, it is a necessity to be able to react, to be able to protect ourselves when third states seek to limit our freedom. Mr President, your country and the Lithuanians show that acting as Europeans is the only way to defend democracy, to respond to today's challenges, and to build our strategic autonomy. Faced with the pandemic, we acted as Europeans: the joint purchase of vaccines, the transfer of patients between Member States, the adoption of the recovery plan. Faced with the illegal and unjustified aggression against Ukraine, we are acting as Europeans: sanctions, macro-financial assistance, provision of weapons. Faced with the energy crisis, we continue to act as Europeans: creation of new supply lines, reinvestment in new green energies, creation of a social climate fund. Faced with the siren calls of division, we must continue to act as Europeans: let us strengthen dialogue between our societies, strengthen dialogue between our states, strengthen dialogue with third states. Let us continue to act as sovereign and solidary Europeans. Because to overcome critical dependencies, to feed our fellow citizens, to meet the challenge of climate transition, to leave no one behind, we must engage in dialogue, make progress, but above all, act together. In Parliament, we are ready for this. It is up to us to follow this path. The path your people are charting so that these actions do not go unanswered and that we collectively live up to the concerns and aspirations of all Europeans.

There is concern regarding the income of the country's farmers, the management of the milk crisis, and the potential consequences of this crisis for the future of Lithuanian agriculture. I am concerned that the country's regional policy has still not met expectations, as the income gap between those living in the country's regions and the capital is still quite significant.

When documents are falsified, they undermine internal security in the Schengen area, which is an area of free movement without border controls. This new law addresses this problem by ensuring enhanced cooperation between European Union Member States and partner countries, to take steps regarding the authenticity or falsity of documents. This will guarantee greater security at the external borders and the security of the citizens we represent. We know that the only way we can enjoy the benefits that the Schengen area brings is for our citizens to have confidence in the management of the external borders. And this law is instrumental and essential in all of this – borders, security, and the fight against crime. The new law will help to identify and intercept falsified documents. This law provides a framework for this to happen without delay and with the assistance of Frontex, which will also be responsible for sharing information with all participating countries, assisting and informing them on how to detect situations involving document falsification. The law clarifies Frontex's role in establishing FADO. We have strengthened what falls under this law so that FADO includes more information than it does today. We want uniformity and consistency in the level of information that FADO holds regarding the genuineness, falsity, and fraudulent nature of documents, and for the information to be centralised. We also wanted Frontex to have the necessary flexibility to establish and improve FADO. We ensured that the Agency drafts a new document on effective measures for identifying falsification methods. Naturally, we did everything we could to ensure personal data is compliant with European laws. The result should lead to greater protection while simultaneously guaranteeing stricter security. FADO is essential in the fight against falsification, particularly at the external borders. The participation of countries that are not European Union partners but participate in the Schengen area is also crucial, as ultimately this will have a positive impact on the security of the external borders. This might seem like an overly technical system, but it is a system which I believe we agree is essential to complement the reform of European borders and the protection of these borders. In these negotiations, we did our utmost to broaden the responsibilities falling under this Regulation. This was done while detailing the specific responsibilities of the Agency and ensuring that the processing of personal data by the Agency and the Member States complies with European laws. We also ensured that the Parliament has a greater role in FADO. Finally, I would like to thank the Council, the Finnish and Croatian Presidencies, as well as my colleagues from all political groups for the very constructive work we have done.

The use of fraudulent documents by foreign citizens seeking a better life in Europe is common, and the cost of such a document can reach up to 5-6 thousand euros. Document fraud is one of the main enablers for terrorism and organised crime and is linked to the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and stolen vehicles, as well as human trafficking and, especially in recent years, migrant smuggling. Not infrequently, the obtaining of authentic travel documents is based on fraudulent identity documents. This is precisely what makes their detection so difficult. In this regard, it is crucial to enhance the security of travel documents issued in the European Union, including the related identity management infrastructure. On the other hand, cooperation between different authorities must go beyond law enforcement activities, as it requires establishing links with document-issuing authorities, as well as with international organisations, airlines, shipping companies, and others. In view of all this, I call on you to support the proposal for integrating the online system for fraudulent and authentic documents into the European Border and Coast Guard, as a final step towards completing its reform.\n",

Yes, inasmuch as it can lead to criminality, money laundering from illicit business, or even terrorism. Does the European Parliament have something to say? The answer is yes; we are saying it. We are ready to support an instrument that ensures the storage, exchange, and verification of false documents, to combat fraud, and we are willing to trust the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, which we strengthened with the Regulation we adopted in 2019, to be responsible for securely sharing this information with the Member States, with the European Union, with international relations and, ultimately, with all entities that may be relevant for verifying the true identity of individuals enjoying free movement in the Schengen area. Our demand is always that this be compatible with the work we have done to ensure data confidentiality, fundamental rights. Ultimately, the foundational values of the European Union. But it is a fact that we must combat the insecurity related to people circulating in our Schengen area with all available technological tools and with the necessary legal guarantee.

      "\tMr President, let me start by thanking the rapporteur, Ms Metsola, for her work. As a new Member of this House working on my first legislative file, I very much appreciated her lead. Now on substance. Verifying the authenticity of travel documents has been turning for quite some time into a pressure point in the work of border guards, because of time constraints, the tremendous increase in the number of travellers in Europe, and the diversity of travel documents that are being used. Furthermore, the sophistication of forgery techniques has been a constant challenge for our law enforcement officials. The new FADO system has already been in use for some time, serving these needs. What we are now doing, and this is very important, is to bring it from the intergovernmental into the Community method by adding it to the list of instruments entrusted to the EBCGA (European Border and Coast Guard Agency) as part of the enlarged mandates that we decided to give last year. This means increased accountability towards, and scrutiny by, this House, and higher safeguards in the regime applicable to the data contained therein and the measurement of access rights. The protection of personal data was one of the main issues that we had to deal with during the negotiations of this file, and we made sure that the processing of personal data is limited to what is strictly necessary for the purpose of detecting or investigating document fraud. We also introduced clear rules on accessing the database, with Member States now having an express obligation to determine which authorities competent in the area of document fraud are to have access to the FADO system and their level of access, and then to notify the Commission and the Agency. The Commission, upon request, will now have to transmit this information to this House. The negotiated text complements the reform of the EBCGA and will ensure better protection of the Union’s external borders and more efficient law enforcement. I therefore encourage my fellow MEPs to support this text.\n",

      "\tMr. President, honourable colleagues, I thank our colleague Ms. Metsola for her work. In recent years, we have witnessed a significant increase in document fraud in the Schengen area, perpetrated both through the falsification of genuine documents and the use of forged documents. This measure will allow us to integrate the management of the online system for false and authentic documents, known as FADO, within Frontex, whose management model is now obsolete. The need for defence and security that our citizens demand of us compels us to ensure a very high level of alert against false documents, as they are criminal tools suitable for reuse in various crimes, including money laundering and terrorism, but above all, illegal immigration. Indeed, forged documents have often been used by asylum seekers attempting to enter Europe. These are behaviours that we cannot tolerate and that must be stopped. It therefore becomes essential to provide the police, border guards, and customs with a more efficient database, capable of allowing for the rapid identification of falsified documents and effective combatting of these phenomena. For these reasons, we support the proposal, despite our stated disagreement with some private entities accessing FADO, even if with limitations. Although we are against the reform of the Frontex agency's regulation, we consider the importance of using FADO today to be paramount in the fraud combatting activities carried out by Member State authorities.\n",

We will obviously be vigilant to ensure that this does not portend a strengthening of the agency's mandate – FADO is not a tool to combat migration, but rather an instrument to combat false documents in general. The overall compromise is balanced, particularly through the establishment of safeguards allowing third parties, namely airlines from third countries, to access the database, albeit with limited access. Although the database contains little personal data, it nevertheless seemed necessary to us to make any identification via documents in FADO impossible, which is now the case.

This fact highlights the great importance that the protection of our borders and migration control have for the security of our nationals. The Regulation, the FADO system, will facilitate, leveraging Frontex's experience, a rapid and efficient exchange of information, without prejudice, furthermore, to Member States being able to develop better systems for the detection, prevention and prosecution of crimes.

This is concerning, because wherever false documents are used, our security is at stake. It is therefore crucial that police officers and border guards across Europe can verify the authenticity of documents from other Member States, that they are aware of the technical specifications of those documents from other countries, and that fake copies circulating in the EU are truly known everywhere. This truly represents a European added value: sharing information between Member States, ensuring that this information is always updated, and ensuring that this information is accessible and available to everyone 24/7. This new system is therefore a very welcome and much-needed new system, because in the area of security, too, we are stronger together than alone.

For effective enforcement action, however, a constant exchange of information is necessary, which must not only take place between the authorities of the Union countries but also, with the necessary safeguards for personal data, with European institutions, third countries, and private entities, such as airlines, which can contribute to the proper functioning of the FADO system. Numerous investigations conducted by Europol have repeatedly shown that forged documents are often the means used by criminal organisations to commit other much more serious crimes, such as human trafficking, migrant smuggling, or even for the preparation of terrorist attacks. To prevent the commission of such crimes, therefore, among other measures, stricter control at external borders is necessary. We therefore welcome the fact that the regulation transfers the competence relating to the system for managing forged and authentic documents to FADO, from the Council to Frontex, thus finally completing the legislative reform of this agency, a reform which, however, must be followed by proper and complete implementation to truly make the rules approved so far effective.

      "\tMr President, the Millennium Development Goals set clear objectives that include the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger and the drastic reduction of child mortality. Looking at progress in this area, we have made progress, but despite that, the number of children dying or suffering from undernutrition remains unacceptably high. This oral question and resolution seeks to ensure this issue is given the priority it deserves by the Commission in our collective action towards the post-2015 global development framework. Undernutrition represents an enormous development challenge. The World Health Organisation says that undernutrition is the biggest contributor to child mortality, causing 35% of the disease burden in children under five. It can create a vicious cycle of poverty, can reduce productivity and impede social and economic development. That is why the fight against child undernutrition and the provision of universal access to adequate nutritious food should remain as one of the major goals in the post-2015 agenda. We voted on Tuesday on that issue, and it is something we do feel is very important. In the draft document by the Own Working Group of the United Nations, goal 2 of the draft SDGs has a target to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030 and by 2025 achieve the internationally-agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under five. The World Health Organisation Assembly endorses the global target for a 40% reduction of the global number of children under five who are stunted by 2025. That means reducing the number of stunted children by more than 70 million – 70 million, colleagues – by 2025. In the Stier report on Tuesday, our Parliament voted with a huge majority to support this objective and goes further, calling for the zero hunger goal to end the scandal of hunger by 2025. It calls for promoting sustainable agriculture and recognising the specific needs of women farmers related to food security. These are vital efforts in our fight against child malnutrition. So what we are asking the Commission for this morning, and why we have asked for this debate, is because we now need a concrete action plan from the Commission on how we, as the European Union, can contribute to the child undernutrition targets, and how we can work with our international partners to achieve this. I understand that the Commission services have been working on an action plan on nutrition, and I wonder, Commissioner, could you update us on this and tell us what is happening and when we can expect something concrete? And how can the Commission ensure coordination, both in its different policies and with our international partners, in speeding up progress towards the WHO targets? Reduced and ending child undernutrition is possible but, like our other development policies, it requires resources, coordination and political will. This week we have had a debate marking the 25th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Tackling undernutrition in the next 15 to 20 years would be a key contribution to make sure that every child could have the basic right that gives them the opportunity for a decent life.\n",

It was already mentioned here that this week we voted on the document, what will happen after 2015 with the Millennium Goals. Malnutrition is a truly complex problem that burdens the entire society. It lies as a burden, because basic human rights are not respected when there is insufficient nutrition, and that is the right to a dignified life of the smallest, those children who live in hunger. When we consider that several children die every minute, not because there is a war in their countries and not because they are sick, but because they are hungry. And it's not just those children who die, it's other children, thousands and thousands of children, who suffer lifelong consequences from this lack of nutrition. We are talking about numbers here - I think we already know those numbers almost by heart, but cooperation is important, cooperation is important both with the institutions of the European Union, but also with other organizations that deal with nutrition, especially with the FAO. There should be a meeting this week, and I think that cooperation should be closer. And just one more sentence: I believe that what the commissioner said at the hearing, that we will look more at poverty, we will look more at hunger than at climate change.\n",

      "\tMr President, ladies and gentlemen, dear Commissioner, I welcome you and I would like to tell you that our first meeting in this Chamber is taking place on a particularly significant topic, because there are such dramatic realities to which we almost end up becoming accustomed, as if they were inevitable. But then, looking at them a little more closely, we realize that they are not at all inevitable or inexorable, that they are tragic but perfectly solvable realities. We know how it should be done, we know what tools should be put in place, we know the causes of these phenomena and we see their effects. And therefore I think that the very fact – as my colleague also said – that they are not inevitable should really make us take on a great responsibility and understand that if it is possible to do it, we must do it. The problem is whether we are able, whether we want to deploy the tools and above all do it adequately. Today this phenomenon of malnutrition, of child malnutrition, takes on even more subtle, more hidden forms: it is the so-called hidden hunger, which is less evident, less impactful even as images that reach our eyes, to knowledge through NGOs and health workers. international cooperation, but which are equally negative and detrimental to the development of boys and girls. And therefore this phenomenon of hidden hunger is also among those that we want to address. We are mobilizing these days with renewed vigor precisely to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. And I really thank our president Linda McAvan and all my colleagues and shadow colleagues because around the re-proposal of this resolution we want to tell you that our commitment as Parliament is there, not only of the DEVE commission, but of the entire Parliament. We ask the Commission to take this step forward with equal effectiveness, with equal conviction. I really think that we should not have - I say this first of all to myself - the right to commemorate and celebrate if we do not accompany this right with a serious commitment, a measurable commitment (you spoke of numbers, figures and dates, and we appreciated it) and a commitment that also looks at effectiveness in its use. We know that the resources allocated to international development, like other resources within the Union, are not always used effectively, but here we cannot afford to lose anything. So this dimension of monitoring effectiveness, of understanding what happens to our plans, also becomes absolutely essential. So I believe we must make these commitments with renewed vigor. You spoke about these plans, you also spoke about the need to carry out an evaluation of the effectiveness to see how to reprogram the interventions. Here, I ask you to maintain a very collaborative and very engaging relationship with Parliament throughout this process because you will find, as you have seen, in the commission great skills and great passion and therefore a great desire to collaborate in developing the most effective measures . Many things have been done – Linda McAvan cited some results, she cited them – and I think that Europe should be proud of having contributed to these results. However, the phenomenon is returning in certain geographical areas and places where it did not exist due to the economic crisis, due to speculation on the prices of food, of essential food products. Therefore we also ask you to involve your colleagues for a vision of a slightly more horizontal and all-round policy to trace the causes of some of these phenomena which can be tackled perhaps in other sectors, with a different agricultural policy, for example, with a different commercial policy, with a financial policy. This phenomenon of commodity speculation on food is something – I believe – intolerable for the common opinion of this Parliament. Finally, a final observation: we have all seen, by reading and documenting ourselves, not only for this occasion but for our work, how the role of women is fundamental. There are data that make you shudder: women contribute 80% of food production in developing countries and are 60% of the malnourished; they contribute to producing and being the real farmers, and have 2% of the ownership. Here we also make politics towards women, who are an element of development in many countries, not only in the West we know.\n",

Just the day before yesterday, in this room, Pope Francis said: \"We cannot accept that millions of people around the world are dying of hunger, while every day tons of food are thrown away from our tables.\" According to research conducted by the United Nations, 1.3 million tons of food are destroyed every year. Ladies and Gentlemen! No actions by the Commission, no subsidies spent on combating the problem of malnutrition will bring results if we do not first comprehensively change legal regulations and practices of food producers. Why do we need to debate this general document if, in accordance with EU law, it will still be possible to speculate on the prices of products by throwing away tons of food products in order to prevent their prices from falling. And punish those who share their food surpluses with taxes. In this context, the Commission's proposals to tackle child hunger by promoting gender equality and empowering women in all areas related to nutrition seem like a grim joke. We must have the courage to tell ourselves the brutal truth here in this room. It is EU legislation that largely allows for unethical practices by food producers. If we want to counteract the greatest shame of today - the scourge of hunger among children - we must take really decisive action and start by changing the regulations that have so far thwarted many of our efforts to improve the lives of the weakest among us.

Examining this issue in the European Parliament therefore requires us to focus on a humanitarian, political, economic and developmental scourge which requires a coordinated and coherent response. This is obviously an ethical imperative which also generates collateral economic effects. We all know – it has been said and repeated here – that more than 165 million children under the age of five are undernourished and that the first thousand days of life are of capital importance for the development of child. We all know the nutritional crises that recurrently strike the Sahel and sub-Saharan Africa. What interests me is how we are going to tackle the causes of this evil? We cannot dissociate this question from that of food self-sufficiency. I would like – I have great confidence in you, I had the opportunity to attend your performance at the time of your audition, so I think that you are certainly aware of these questions – that, in Your plan and your approach must first take into account the need for cross-cutting policies that are not focused only on undernutrition but also on the issue of food self-sufficiency. I have yet to hear about the topic of land grabbing; I see that in Africa, there is a real tendency in the economic world to grab land, a tendency with obviously dramatic consequences. There was talk of water, there is also education and technical transfer, perhaps from us, which can improve the productivity and yield of these lands. I agree with the speaker who highlights the fact that it is quite scandalous to allow financial speculation on food. As for the question of women, I obviously agree because I am a privileged witness to the major role of women, particularly in Africa and in the economic world.

In my country, in Galicia, there are more than 20% of children below the poverty level. In the Spanish State, today, 60% more people are at risk of poverty and social exclusion than in 2007. The cause of this situation lies in the policies of the European Union, which make it possible for multinationals to steal people's wealth, which prevent them from developing their agriculture, which occupy their lands, which impose free trade agreements that are ruinous for people. Without questioning these policies there will be no solution to hunger and malnutrition in the south, without putting an end to the troika's policies, hunger and malnutrition in the north will continue to spread. Sr. Commissioner, we must radically change the European Union's neoliberal policies, with urgent measures such as putting an end to the rapacious policies of multinationals, putting an end to free trade agreements, acting, adapting and changing agricultural and food policies within the framework of food sovereignty. Anything other than moving forward with measures of this type will be empty words, and next year we will continue here to count numbers of malnourished people, numbers of people dying of hunger.\n",

      "\tToday we are voting on an important report. Because it is shameful that millions of children still have to suffer from hunger and that every few minutes a child dies of hunger. I am also very pleased - a big thank you to Mrs McAvan - that in this report we are not just talking about malnutrition, but also about malnutrition, because it is not enough for children to get enough calories. For healthy growth and age-appropriate development, they need a balanced diet with vitamins and trace elements, to name just a few. However, we will not achieve this if we continue to promote the usual monocultures. They displace diversified cultivation systems with different types of grain and vegetables and thus also the production of the required micronutrients. I here call on the EU to follow the recommendations of the EU Special Rapporteur on the right to food, who explicitly identifies more organic agriculture as a way for these countries to feed themselves, and who also refers to the role of agriculture in climate change and poverty alleviation. It is therefore important to promote and support small farmers because they have the potential to spread diverse climate-friendly farming systems, they have the potential to produce fair food that corresponds to local dietary habits, they have the potential to create an economy to build. Because primary production is also linked to processing, transport and trade in the region. This is where the potential for workers lies and therefore the first step out of poverty. But without land, food cannot be grown. This means that traditional land rights must be protected and access to land must be ensured for the local population, especially women. The winner here cannot be the one who puts more money on the table. The local population must be the winner here, and we must under no circumstances encourage further land grabbing. Investments in agriculture are absolutely necessary. They are necessary if we want to combat hunger and poverty in developing countries. But not every type of investment in agriculture is helpful here. If private investors end up driving the local population more or less away from their own resources and depriving them of them in order to carry out this essential food production themselves, in order to produce large margins for the world market, for international markets, then no child will be fed up. Trade agreements must also take this into account in the future, they must also do justice to this. Otherwise, these countries will become more and more dependent on the international raw material markets and on the fluctuations in prices on these markets. They become dependent on food speculation, and stock market developments therefore become decisive in determining whether a child can go to bed hungry or full at the end of the day. This is extremely immoral and we have to fight against it. Poverty and hunger can be prevented by providing sufficient support to local farmers. This is the only way for these countries to achieve food sovereignty. We need further greening of farming systems to adapt them to climate change, because it is precisely these countries that will be the first to be affected by climate change. Both are basic elements in the fight against poverty and hunger.\n",

Unlike democratic Ethiopia, the Egyptian military ruler in the neighbouring country is causing problems by trying to enforce an old colonial right over the Nile. I think this is not sustainable; I think that Ethiopia, which contributes over 80% of the waters of the Nile, should have access to the Nile, not just for generating electricity but also for agriculture, and for feeding and providing water for its citizens.

Of these, 225 million children are under the age of 5 and are chronically malnourished. Technological progress has made it possible, among other things, to have food for everyone, but despite this, children still die of hunger and are still malnourished. It is a scandal, as Pope Francis called it, whose messages I hope we have not only listened to and quickly forgotten, but have accepted and supported with our long applause in this House. So there is food for all, but no justice for all. That's why this week we passed the Resolution on a new global framework for development and we asked the European Union and the international community to focus on the causes of poverty and hunger. And in this Resolution of colleague McAvan, it is clearly mentioned what those causes are, and there are more of them. But, in short, if we are going to reason following the Pope's messages, then we have to conclude that the main causes of poverty and hunger are actually selfish human behaviors and policies that have only material interests at their center, and those of the strongest, and ignore the dignity of human life in its entire duration. Yes, as a Christian Democrat I will emphasize that the issue of child malnutrition shows that the dignity of human life must be protected from the very beginning. As stated in paragraph 3 of this Resolution, the first 1000 days of a child's life are the most important, including the period of pregnancy. However, it is not enough to say that we want to protect life from the beginning, it is also necessary, through an effective coherent development policy, to enable that child when he is born to have quality nutrition, access to health care, education, and we all have to work much harder on this together. In this regard, I welcome the Commission's intention to invest EUR 3.5 billion, as well as the intention of the commissioner who said that he wants strict monitoring for the implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of these programs. And I also expect that the Council in December will support the goal of this Parliament for the complete eradication of hunger, the so-called Zero Hunger Goal.\n",

We can feed 10 billion people with the current arable area, provided we stop spending most of our grains and crops on animal feed, on biofuel. 70% of arable land is used to feed animals instead of people. To achieve this, Brussels' agricultural policy must be drastically reformed and we must stop providing our own farmers with 363 billion euros in agricultural subsidies, we must stop dumping agricultural surpluses in developing countries. However, the best measure is simple and cheap: our consumption pattern. We need to eat less meat! Every five seconds a child dies of hunger.

We really know that the mental development of a child under the age of 5 is also hindered if he does not get enough important micronutrients with food. UNICEF, for example, has taken this issue very seriously and taken action on it. Indeed, as the commissioner says, the EU can also act through UN organizations to promote this issue. It is largely a question of the fact that there has also been a shift to more one-sided farming. Because of this, the Greens have presented an amendment that emphasizes the importance of an agroecological approach. That has also been the message of the UN special rapporteur. Namely, it gives opportunities for more versatile farming, which in turn means that specifically mothers who are farmers in Africa can offer more versatile nutrition to children, which is absolutely necessary for their development. I would also like to draw attention to an issue that my colleague Michel also addressed, i.e. land grabbing. We should be able to study how the European Union's free trade agreements with developing countries actually affect the fact that large companies are increasingly taking over large farming areas from the governments of developing countries, which in turn reduce the opportunities for small farmers. We would like an investigation into this. The World Agricultural Organization FAO has drawn up good codes of conduct for this matter, the Voluntary Guidelines, and I hope that they will gradually become binding, so that the needs of poor people, the majority of the world, are really taken into account and not sacrificed to big companies.\n",

Great progress has been made towards achieving one of the Millennium Development Goals, namely halving the rate of undernourished people in developing countries. However, the problem has not disappeared, it is ubiquitous and complicated. I therefore support the content of the draft resolution. The leading cause of malnutrition among children in all regions of the world is poverty. The most difficult situation is in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. According to UNICEF data, approximately 100 million children worldwide suffer from malnutrition, and over 50 million children under the age of five suffer from hunger. However, as many as 160 million children around the world suffer from short stature. Malnutrition hinders a child's physical development, weakens his or her intellect, ability to concentrate and learn, and consequently deprives him or her of the chance to be independent in the future, find a good job and break the cycle of poverty in which he or she grows up. Therefore, in the report on the global development framework after 2015, which was passed yesterday by a large majority, MEP Davor Stier mentioned combating poverty and, therefore, hunger and malnutrition among children as the most important goal. As a member of the DEVE committee, I would like to emphasize the particular need to help developing countries by supporting their actual development, which will enable them to be self-sufficient in the future. We cannot refuse emergency help, especially in extreme cases where not only children but their entire families suffer from hunger. Malnutrition is particularly dangerous for pregnant women because it can cause significant damage or impede the development of the fetus. Well-nourished children are hope for future generations, they are healthier and learn better. Thanks to this, they have a chance to provide themselves and others with decent living conditions in the future. Meanwhile, in the world today, every 5/6 seconds - as we already know - one child dies. Together we can change this.\n",

Two billion people in the world suffer from hidden hunger; millions of children suffer from extreme hunger leading to death. More than ever we must be aware that something needs to be done on a global scale so that children have not only enough food but a balanced diet. There are also pregnant women, who are suffering from hunger, with the painful and permanent consequences, which this brings on their babies. Therefore we must also focus on these women and on the babies - especially in the first 1000 days where their development is so crucial. One of the solutions for this is education. Education gives an important job and economic growth potential to fight hunger and poverty, to have a sustainable development and an improvement in the social situation. Learning about food and nutrition should be an integral part of formal education, so that we grow a healthy generation capable of living in a dignified way. An investment in this sense is an investment in the future; investment in people who are able to find work to survive themselves and support their families.

Thus, before the age of five, little girls are three times more likely than little boys to suffer from severe malnutrition. Deprived of good nutritional conditions and therefore even more vulnerable to growth problems, girls are more likely to die when they are still very young. It is therefore appropriate to identify cultural and religious obstacles in discriminatory practices and attitudes harmful to girls, and obviously try to remedy them. Furthermore, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, if women farmers had access to the same means of production as men, they could increase yields worldwide by 20 to 30% and increase the agricultural production for food purposes. In other words, these advances would prevent 100 million people, or even 150 million, from going hungry. Consequently, fighting against inequalities between men and women and between girls and boys from a very young age, putting an end to the unfavorable treatment of little girls, improving the prospects of women farmers, these are concrete areas for fighting against malnutrition of children in developing countries.

      "\tMr President, first of all I want to start by recognizing the role of the European Union in helping development and combating child malnutrition. However, the food and financial crises since 2008 have once again caused these figures to increase and endanger the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Therefore, although the 3.5 billion euros announced by the Commission to combat this situation are positive, a greater effort is needed. To do this, it is necessary to review the actions we have undertaken and frame them within a plan that includes the main axes that Unicef itself has set as a roadmap. In this multisectoral plan I would dare to highlight three major objectives: the first objective, a program for the child's first thousand days, considered critical for their subsequent development; the second, the promotion of small-scale agriculture; and, thirdly and no less important, stimulate and encourage the participation of women in the distribution of resources, because it is clear and recognized that, when women distribute resources within the family and control them, malnutrition within the family it is much lower. Therefore, let us empower women, give them ownership of land and educate women and girls.\n",

      "\tMr. President, with 3.1 million child deaths each year in developing countries, malnutrition is the largest factor in mortality in children under five years of age. The fight against child malnutrition is and remains one of the main Millennium Development Goals for 2015. When we talk about child malnutrition, we always link it to food insecurity and poverty, but also to unhealthy home environments and inadequate access to health services. Currently 805 million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy life, most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa and also in Asia. One in nine people in the world is in this situation. In the world there are also 66 million school-age children who go to school hungry. The first thousand days of a child's life are fundamental—it has been said here—so that they can have full growth and their dignity can be respected. It is the period that is considered, therefore, most critical to prevent malnutrition and its consequences in adulthood. It is true that the European Union has made an important effort in all development cooperation issues, but we still must do more to be able to alleviate this problem, with innovative financing, but also with long-term financing. What is intended is that we can talk about the availability of food, the accessibility of these foods and also that these foods can be adapted to the needs of the children themselves. We must invest more in health, in education, but also in equal opportunities. A large part of women and children who work in agriculture, if they had the same rights and if they had the same opportunities and the same access to services as men, would not be in this situation. Therefore, I would like to encourage the Commission and the Commissioner to work along these lines. Above all, political will is needed to invest in these areas.\n",

Therefore, I would like to bring to this debate the expression child hunger within the European Union. Particularly in the countries intervened by the Troika, it is urgent to talk about the hunger created by unemployment, bankruptcies and an absent State. In my country, Portugal, it is the schools that guarantee children a hot meal. These are the same schools that open their doors on Saturdays and Sundays to ensure that children do not go without food. And do you know why? Because in a country of unemployment, where migration is forced, parents cannot feed and support their children. In 2011 – we are talking about the middle of the crisis – around 29% of Portuguese children were at risk of poverty. With the poverty imposed by austerity, it is estimated that 35 thousand children are hungry in my country. There is hunger in Europe, there is hunger in Greece, in Spain, in Portugal, in Ireland.

As other colleagues have said, every single day, 22 000 children die of malnutrition, and 90% of those deaths are within Asia and Africa. Every single death is preventable, and I think we need to ensure that the political will is in place to resolve this issue once and for all. Colleagues have spoken about the need to support farmers in the developing world, to make sure that they have the right equipment, the right technology, to make sure they have support. We have also spoken about the need to improve diet, to make sure that there is a sustainable food supply. We have also spoken about the need to ensure that discrimination, especially discrimination against women, is tackled within the developing world, and the position of women in terms of education at home and in the workplace also needs to be tackled. We also have to encourage greater use of breastfeeding to avoid contaminated water; and I think, crucially, a plan needs to be built around a child’s first 1 000 days, which other people have spoken about. The first two years are crucial in terms of getting on top of the problem of malnutrition. I think tackling food price volatility and food price security is another issue that we need to address. Even though progress has been made, much more can be done, and if we resolve to do this together, working with other partners throughout the world, I believe that we can address this even further.

Unfortunately, children in developing countries suffer the most from hunger and deprivation. As I mentioned, child abuse is related to lack of food and family poverty, exclusion, inadequate care and feeding practices, inadequate health care services. Child poverty in developing countries is not only caused by food shortages and inadequate infrastructure, but also by food distribution problems, unequal access to food and insufficient purchasing power, especially given high food prices, which are further inflated by speculation. It is painful that today's reality is that in some countries we talk about how to reduce food waste, while in others we count children dying of hunger.

Therefore, introducing regulations on the possibility of member states to limit or prohibit the use of genetically modified food and feed on their territory is an unnecessary step. All the more so since even the previously valid conditions on the possibility of granting an exemption have never been met. The safety clause has been invoked by the states in nine cases so far, but in all these cases it was found by the EU's scientific committees that there were no reasons that would justify changing the original decision on the permit. Moreover, it is almost impossible to implement the proposed regulation, as there are no longer border controls within the EU agricultural sector. The reintroduction of such controls between member states would reverse the economic achievements of the European customs union and the single market. In addition, the dependence of the Union's animal production on genetically modified feed must be taken into account. The adoption of the regulation could result in a reduction of production in the EU, and thus the necessity of imports from countries that have lower animal production standards than the Union.\n",

The lack of borders also raises great doubts about the controls that would regulate the introduction of GMO products in the various markets. The division of the single market would also cause a threat to competitive balances. The different access to GMO feed, on which the European agricultural sector is highly dependent, could, in fact, change the competitiveness of one Member State compared to another.

A review of the authorization procedures for genetically modified food and feed is urgently needed, and such food should not be placed on the market before a risk assessment has been carried out.\n",

      "\tIn April 2015, the Commission published a proposal in which it proposes to allow Member States to restrict or ban genetically modified foods and feed under certain conditions. These national measures should be reasonable and justified by good reasons, which should not conflict with the risk assessment carried out by the European Food Safety Authority, and they should also be proportionate and non-discriminatory. I share the concerns expressed in the report on the pending impact assessment regarding the compliance of the measures taken by the Member States with internal market and WTO rules and the practical feasibility of the proposal. As the EU is still heavily dependent on the supply of protein from genetically modified sources and as the proposal could have an indirect negative impact on imports, I believe that it could seriously threaten livestock production and negatively impact EU agriculture. The proposal also does not provide the necessary legal certainty and an appropriate tool for member states that would like to legally limit or prohibit the use of genetically modified food and feed on their territory. The possibility of such a restriction or ban would reintroduce some kind of border controls between member states, thus reversing the economic achievements of the European customs union and the single market.

The Commission proposal would be the beginning of the end of our common internal market. Border controls would have to be reintroduced between member states to prevent genetically modified feed from entering a country that has imposed an import ban. There would be massive distortions of competition in EU agriculture and an unmanageable chaos. The possibility of import bans is also completely unrealistic because European agriculture is dependent on the import of protein feed for its existence. Only 5% of our demand for soy, used as feed in animal production, is produced in the EU. The rest comes from countries such as the USA, Canada and Brazil, where genetically modified plants are primarily grown. In any case, animal products would become significantly more expensive for consumers and meat production, which is also one of the EU's largest export businesses, would move to third countries. So the proposal is dangerous nonsense. The import of GMO food and feed is strictly regulated by law in the EU. These rules guarantee the safe handling of GMOs, and it should stay that way.\n",

The Committee has the opportunity, and the major challenge, following recent events in the United Kingdom, of maintaining dialogue with citizens, as it has the potential to reconnect institutions and EU citizens.

The committee's program of activities is not tied to the legislative program of the European Commission, but rather is tailored by citizens who, by exercising their right to submit petitions to the European Parliament, express their concerns regarding issues in various political and legislative areas of the Union.

In 2015, 1,431 petitions were received, which is 47% less than in 2014. In 2015, according to the number of submitted petitions, Spain is in first place, followed by Italy and Germany. The analysis of the statistical data related to petitions shows that the main reasons for the inadmissibility of petitions are the fact that petitioners still confuse the competences of the EU and the Member States and that they do not distinguish between the EU institutions. The European Commission continues to be the primary partner of the Committee on Petitions in the handling of petitions, as it is responsible for monitoring the application and compliance with EU legislation.

      "\tMr President, President Michel, Vice—President Šefčovič, welcome back to the European Parliament. The decision of the European Council to grant candidate status to Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova and to offer this perspective to Georgia, once it fulfils the conditions, was correct. This is a decision supported by the European Parliament and it corresponds to the expectations of the people in these countries. The people of Ukraine are defending European values with their lives in Ukraine and the people of Moldova have opened their houses to Ukrainian refugees. More Ukrainian refugees have entered the Republic of Moldova in relation to its population than any EU Member State. We, as the European Parliament, have understood early that we can only live in safety and security within the borders of the European Union if the countries in our immediate neighbourhood borders are safe and stable. This is why we called already in March for Ukraine, and in May for the Republic of Moldova, to work towards granting this candidate status. Because in these times we have to act quickly, clearly without hesitation. Dear colleagues, Members of the Parliament, thank you very much for the fact that Parliament stood united since the beginning of this war in supporting countries in our eastern neighbourhood. Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova still have a long way to go before they are ready for EU membership but, Vice-President Šefčovič, we have to make sure that we start this process at a technical level and we have to make sure that even before these countries are ready to join, we support them and we make sure that the people in these countries can start feeling the benefits of getting closer to the European Union. The Council made the right decisions on Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, but the outcome on Western Balkans was disappointing. I was encouraged, President Michel, by your remarks today, and I believe we all have to work together so that we make sure that the Czech Presidency succeeds where the French Presidency has not managed to succeed, in offering a clear perspective to the Western Balkan countries. Good news came from the European Council when it comes to the euro area. Thank you, President Michel, for endorsing Croatia’s readiness to become a member of the euro area on 1 January. We have yesterday voted with a large majority here to approve Croatia’s entry into the euro area on 1 January. Every single member of the four largest groups in the European Parliament, and many colleagues in the other groups, have voted in favour. So thank you very much dear colleagues, this shows us that Croatia’s path on strengthening its economy, on managing its budget with care, on getting closer to the euro area under the leadership of Prime Minister Andrej Plenković, was correct. It pays off. It is good news for Croatia. It is good news for the euro area. It will make the euro area stronger and it shows the trust in our common currency. Last point, it is our duty, dear colleagues, to further strengthen the European Union. We have to equip the European Union with the tools it needs to overcome the problems that people are facing. We held the Conference on the Future of Europe but, President Michel, the outcome of the European Council saying that ‘we take note of this and we are happy that there was an exchange with citizens’ is too little. We have to take the ideas of the citizens on board. We have to solve their problems and we have to do this together. Council, Commission and Members of the European Parliament, we have to make the EU fit for the future. We have to make sure that it can make decisions, it can react fast, and it offers solutions to the problems that people are facing.\n",

The progress on accession requests is certainly positive. The European Union is the home of democracy. We are the institution to which more and more countries look for stability, security, and peace. The shadows, however, are what we still see concerning energy and economic issues, particularly regarding the security of gas supplies and the fight against inflation – issues that simply must have a European response. The Council's conclusions, although urging the Commission to urgently continue efforts to ensure energy supply at affordable prices, effectively postpone the decision to set a European price cap on gas, which could immediately curb the inflation that is also affecting essential goods. Despite the fear among some that Russia might react to a price cap with retaliations, it should be remembered that Putin is already cutting supplies precisely to prevent Europe from filling its storage facilities and thereby increasing the blackmail against us in the winter months, when we will need gas the most. Therefore, we must act now by diversifying supplies, with massive investments in renewable energy, immediately setting a European price cap on gas, and helping families and businesses caught in the vice-grip of high bills, expensive fuel, and inflation, in a context where we are still not out of the pandemic. Time is running out; we do not need European Councils that postpone decisions, but a united and solidary Union that can provide concrete and effective responses.\n",

While the countries joining, we know, have to undertake tough democratic reforms, the job is not theirs alone. But where the European Council is disappointing a growing number of European citizens, President Michel, is when it comes to the debate on the future of the EU. While Parliament has already called for the establishment of a new Convention, the Council conclusions invite the institutions to follow up on the debates of the citizens only within their competences and within the current Treaties, which basically means the EUCO seems to have ruled out Treaty change and a new Convention. It’s a big disappointment. A big disappointment that the French Presidency did not move forward the process of amending the Treaties, as requested by this House. Furthermore, in the programme we just discussed with the Czech Presidency, we only see a vague reference to continuing the debate. President Michel, Europe may be ready to send a political signal for new members, and this is very much welcome, but the Council does not seem ready to address the issue of internal reform to make such commitment a real success.

Never, perhaps, have we been further from it. We will certainly have a universal charger, which is far from useless in everyday life. But what does that represent in light of the increased dependence on the Americans and NATO in matters of defence and foreign policy? For having failed to maintain military means commensurate with the world's challenges and dangers, Europe is forced to place its destiny in the hands of others. This is the very negation of sovereignty and freedom. Instead of striving to consolidate and repair what should be, the European Union continues its headlong rush by making enlargement a dogma, even if it means destabilizing our economic and social models. Hypocrisy regarding ecology and the environment continues unabated, and the French Presidency of the European Union took advantage of its last days to make a nice gift to commercial disorder by signing a new free trade agreement with New Zealand. Finally, despite recurrent posturing, Emmanuel Macron will not have achieved any significant progress in protecting our borders against migratory intrusions from the South and the East.

We hope that this process will progress quickly and that Ukraine will constantly have the support of the European Union, because both the Union and Ukraine itself need it. We also hope that this opportunity will very quickly be extended to other countries applying for membership in the European Union, primarily the Western Balkan countries. And the second issue I want to draw attention to, and which has also been mentioned here, concerns the fact that it seems, from our perspective, the most significant issue for Europeans right now – apart from security, apart from the war ongoing in Ukraine – is the energy crisis, which could affect all European families, linked to high energy prices, a lack of energy sources, and high inflation.

Today I want to talk to you about the elephant in the room that everyone wants to forget: the change to the European treaties. Yes, it was indeed on the agenda of the last Council, I checked. But poof! In the discussions, a little magic trick, the subject seemed to have disappeared. Yet, our Parliament had been very clear about its expectations on the matter. The citizens consulted within the framework of the Conference on the Future of Europe had been just as clear: they expect a radical change to the very foundations of the European Union. What about Emmanuel Macron, who paraded around telling anyone who would listen that a change to the treaties was necessary, a proposal he has since buried – certainly since the elections in France passed? The European Heads of State tell us – and I quote the Council conclusions – that they \"take note of the citizens' demands\". That's nice, but since you simultaneously refuse to debate changing the treaties, I have the feeling that you are mostly taking citizens for fools. And if I summarise, we congratulate citizens who want to change the European Union from top to bottom; but on the other hand, we must be serious: everyone must come home, the party's over, not a comma of the European treaties will be touched. We have been warning since the beginning of the Conference on the Future of Europe that yet another parody of democracy would be very poorly received by citizens, who are tired of being disdained. And yet, that is exactly what is happening. Not only is treaty reform put off until the Greek calends, but moreover the EU is more stubborn than ever in its neoliberal business as usual. I'll give an example: last week, bingo! Another new free trade agreement, this time with New Zealand. A brilliant idea, indeed: ecological dumping, imports from the other side of the planet, our farmers in danger. Bravo, keep it up! And why stop there? What if we were to accelerate the return of austerity and the infamous 3% rule in the midst of a crisis? What if we were to insist even more on competition rules to privatise our trains and public services? What if we were to let an independent central bank, without any democratic control, hold the destiny of 450 million citizens in its hands, who will directly pay the consequences of its decisions? I reiterate forcefully here: the crises we are going through confirm more than ever the need to profoundly modify the current European rules. Our Parliament must take up the issue, demand accountability, put the subject on the table. We, here in the European Parliament, are the only elected representatives within the European institutions.

We in Parliament were the first to call for this, and continuing to support Ukraine and Moldova, as provided for, is absolutely correct. However, it is unacceptable that the Western Balkan states have had to wait so long for EU accession talks and that we have ultimately made no progress whatsoever. I believe we lost a great deal of trust in this region at the last summit. How can it be that the EU is still making North Macedonia wait after 15 years? How can it be that accession talks with Albania have been repeatedly postponed, even though Albania has had candidate status since 2010? Far too little has happened there, and the problem, of course, is unanimity in the Council. That is precisely where we must begin, and that is why it was right that we called for the establishment of a Convention, in order to finally bring about treaty changes and to finally move away from unanimity for major, important decisions, especially foreign policy issues.

It's similar with the sanctions policy: six packages that have been imposed, and the fact that the sanctioned party is then far less affected than those who impose the sanctions.

The decision to continue supporting Ukraine on its path to accession to the Union, along with Moldova, is welcome, but more courage is needed. Our economy is at war; families are struggling to pay their utility bills and buy food, and businesses also have to contend with rising raw material prices. In short, new and urgent measures are required. For months, we have been proposing a cap on the price of gas, an indispensable tool to defend ourselves from rampant inflation, as the G7 also affirmed a few days ago. We could also consider using a replica of the SURE programme to support those countries that help citizens and businesses pay less burdensome bills. In any case, Europe must emerge stronger from this situation. A great European, Václav Havel, wrote that what is needed in politics is the sensitivity to know when, where, how and to whom to speak. I hope that the new Czech Presidency will be able to embrace this legacy to build a new and cohesive Europe.\n",

During the debate on the European Council, its representative is absent, apologizing for other commitments. And that is precisely the attitude towards the citizens who have gone to great lengths, who have submitted proposals for the reform of Europe, and who have put it on record for us that treaty changes are needed, and that requires a Convention. And Parliament has triggered Article 48, and the President of Parliament has also once again put this on record for the Council, stating that they must act. And what are they doing? They are not even present at the debate. It is repeatedly this fear of the goalkeeper facing a penalty kick that endangers the future of Europe. Therefore, esteemed Mr. Michel, should you still be listening: It is important that the Council finally acts and fulfills its role at the next European Council and convenes a Convention.\n",

The recognition of candidate country status for Ukraine and Moldova is certainly an important message of unity and closeness, but we cannot say the same for two countries that have long been candidates, such as Albania and North Macedonia, which once again see their legitimate ambitions disregarded. Never before in history has it been so necessary for the European Union to represent reliability, security, stability. And this applies not only to these countries, but also to our citizens. We must therefore address the issue of energy prices, which are destabilising our economy, with exceptional and urgent measures. The stubborn opposition of some Member States to the proposal put forward by Italy and other countries to set a maximum gas price does not meet the expectations of European families and businesses. A turning point is needed to counter speculation; let us therefore continue on the path set out by REPowerEU and create the conditions to truly become autonomous from Russian fossil fuels.\n",

The EU sanctions do not harm Russia, but they do harm the Member States. Petrol and gas are becoming unaffordable for citizens and businesses. Food shortages are steadily increasing. Meanwhile, Ukraine is receiving 9 billion euros and full military support, but our citizens have to suffer hunger and cold. And this is happening for a war that is not ours, however terrible what is happening there may be.

On the one hand, it condemned the violence of the Russian army and the use of gas to finance Putin's war; on the other hand, it postponed until next autumn the possibility of introducing a cap on the price of gas, thereby allowing Putin to sell less but earn more. A year ago, the price of gas was 18 euros; yesterday it was 170 euros per megawatt-hour. A dramatic situation for businesses and families, but one that evidently suits some European governments, which is the same contradiction why Ukraine's candidacy for the European Union is formalised, but the Ukrainian government's request not to exclude gas and nuclear from the energy sources taxonomy is betrayed in the vote we are about to cast shortly.

The European perspective was confirmed for three countries that deserve it and truly need support because of their resistance to Putin's Russia. However, the Western Balkans can, unfortunately, be spoken of with less optimism. The conclusions, except to some extent in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, registered no progress. The European perspective in this region was confirmed as early as 19 years ago. The blockades to the start of negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia threaten European credibility. This only proves that the European Union itself must also reform in parallel in order to be able to make such decisions more efficiently. Bosnia and Herzegovina has nevertheless been given a certain chance in an election year, but the ruling policies must not repeat old mistakes. The changed geopolitical circumstances should be an incentive for changing political relations in the country, certainly for the better. A place in the European Union awaits Bosnia and Herzegovina.

These countries have strongly demonstrated their desire to join the European Union. Ukraine is currently fighting for freedom and democracy. It must be supported by all means. Similarly, the path of these applicant countries towards European Union membership must be supported, as must the path of the Western Balkan countries. It is clear that actual membership requires significant reforms and great development from all, but the European Union must also reform itself. We will soon have about ten applicant countries, and it is clear that the European Union must strengthen its economic structures, reinforce the implementation of the rule of law, and enhance its foreign policy decision-making capacity, so that we are ready for this enlargement.

The speed used for granting this status is tied to the ongoing Russian invasion. However, the long-term political implications must be kept in mind. On the basis of prevailing rules, the process for these countries to attain membership will take years, perhaps decades. The underlying political rationale could fade or alter with time. Consider Turkey, where claiming that only this country has shown bad faith in its accession process is not tenable. Disillusionment or worse bitterness could eventually colour the relationship between the EU and accession aspirants. As has happened with the EU’s candidacy outreach to the Balkan states. On a more fundamental basis, the EU needs to face out the strategic question that old-timer Henry Kissinger has clearly defined: post Putin and post the EU’s current leaders, Europe will still have to define what relationship it wants with Russia. Does it want Russia as a full partner in a European system or would it like Russia as an Asian power to be held at arm’s length?

      "\tMr. President, on behalf of the majority force in Parliament, I want to congratulate you, President Sassoli, and wish you the best of luck. You have had our votes; I only ask that you do not forget this now or in two and a half years. I also want to congratulate and thank President Tajani, who has always defended the honour and dignity of this Parliament and all its members. Furthermore, I must congratulate both new and veteran colleagues. The responsibility of representing the European people rests on our shoulders. We are the only institution elected by the European people. The one I am not going to congratulate is the Council. With all due respect, President Tusk, you cannot boast about how you have done things, neither in terms of your methods, nor your vetoes, nor your lack of respect for the other institutions. To the extremists — I don't know if they are here today — who last Tuesday turned their backs on the anthem of Europe, I also want to say that we will never turn our backs on the anthem of the United Kingdom. That is the difference between having principles and not having them. Today I speak here on behalf of a deeply pro-European political Group, which has helped build Europe from its foundations; the Group of a founding party of the European Union; a Group that, unlike others, will always be willing to make concessions and sacrifices to reach agreements; a Group proud of its president and the winning candidate in the last European elections, Manfred Weber. Manfred, you have our support! Without intending to, today he represents the spirit of European democracy in the face of the Council. Europe, in addition to appearing democratic, must be democratic. That is why this House has defended the Spitzenkandidat process for years; because we believe that Europeans have the right not only to vote on how they are governed, but also on who governs them. And I tell you one thing: we believed in the Spitzenkandidat yesterday, we believe today, and I assure you that in five years we will continue to believe, because we prefer ballot boxes to closed rooms. The legitimate interests of the governments represented in the Council should not be imposed by the force of the States against the will of the citizens represented in this Parliament. At this point, I will tell you that the European People's Party will support the candidate proposed by the Council, out of responsibility, because she belongs to the political party that won the elections and because at the head of the Commission there will be a capable person ready to fight in defence of Europe's interests. As a political Group, we are also proud that Ursula von der Leyen will be the first woman to lead the European Union, and that she is, precisely, a woman of the centre-right. However, the Council and its candidate will have to negotiate a programme with this House. We invite the members of the Council to share a reflection. The future of Europe must stop being decided behind closed doors and in secret conspiracies. The Spitzenkandidat process is not about a man or a woman. It is about citizens being able to choose the person who governs them in Europe; a truly revolutionary idea: it is called democracy. The Council has the right to propose a candidate for President of the Commission to Parliament. That is true. But the Council does not have the right to ignore all the candidates who have been voted for by European citizens. You, Mr. Tusk, have formed a top leadership of the European Union that excludes Eastern Europe. No one from Eastern Europe is in your package of names. You, Mr. Tusk, have vetoed — yes, vetoed — the candidate for whom more than forty million Europeans voted, the same population as your country or mine. You have vetoed him. You have imposed the structure of the Commission on the candidate for President of the Commission. Not only the structure — even how many vice-presidencies she will have — without consulting her and before Parliament votes on her, which clearly goes against the Treaties. You have tried to tell Parliament who they should appoint as President of the House, and even for how long the Groups should divide the Presidency among themselves. You have gone as far as deciding who will be the president of the European Central Bank as if it were just another political position. That is called poor democratic education. You have proven the Eurosceptics right. Governing from the capitals is also nationalism. None of the presidents who are part of the Council would dare to do in their respective countries what they have done in the Council, because the Constitutional Court would prevent them. If you'll allow me a joke, you are lucky that Article 7 of the Treaty cannot be applied to the Council, because if it could, today, the Commission would have a real problem. You have opened a very serious political conflict between the Council and Parliament over who decides in Europe. And I will tell you one thing: my parliamentary Group is among those who believe that in Europe, the people decide.\n",

      "\tMr President, honourable Members, in the May elections, European citizens sent us a clear message: they trust Europe, but they want change, and I can assure you that my political Group has the commitment and responsibility to drive that change. The person who would have best led that change in the Commission would undoubtedly have been Frans Timmermans. Firstly, due to his status as Spitzenkandidat, who can obtain a majority of votes in this European Parliament, and out of respect for the democratic rules we establish for ourselves. And secondly, and just as important, because our candidate was rejected for defending the values of the Union and the rule of law. Let it be very clear that we will work with renewed energy to ensure those values are respected. But there is an important issue in politics that is also fundamental, and that is consistency. And it is not consistent to come here to tear down the Council's decision and then say that one will vote in favour of it. The truth is, that position is not very consistent. But let us be clear about one thing: the fundamental principle underpinning the European Union is human dignity. And if we were consistent with those values, we would have acted decisively and coordinately long ago to discuss politics in Europe; to discuss how we can respect human rights; to see how we can ensure that the fundamental values of the Union are respected. We must go further. I want to talk about politics and I want to talk about how this Group will lead the changes in Europe. I am glad that the Italian courts have released Captain Carola Rackete. This happens when, indeed, there is separation of powers, and that is why it is essential to preserve the separation of powers against illiberal democracies. But we must go further and prevent these dramatic situations from occurring due to a lack of solidarity in the European Union. It is indecent to criminalise those who save lives and it is indecent to try to gain political advantage from the misfortune of these people. Speaking of politics, and speaking of substance, we will also not support any candidate who intends to remain static in the face of the need for reforms in economic governance, the strengthening of social policies, and ecological transformation. The clock is not waiting. European teenagers tell us this every Friday. Let us act in the face of the global climate emergency; let us not disappoint them. That is why we will be very demanding with the agenda of the next Commission. Climate change demands a transformation that must have two pillars: inclusion, to ensure a just transition, and sustainability. We were disappointed to see the lack of unanimity in fulfilling our commitments adopted in Paris. This Parliament has always been ahead, and our Group will continue to build majorities to urge the Commission and the Council to be more ambitious. And in this regard, I must congratulate the Finnish Presidency of the Council for its proposals for a sustainable future. We continue to talk about politics. We need an ambitious multiannual financial framework to bring about the necessary change; we cannot do more with less. And this Parliament will fight to secure the funds required by the policies we are going to adopt. Do you remember Europe 2020? Well, there are six months left and we have not been able to meet the objectives, to reduce the number of people at risk of poverty and exclusion. Out of twenty million, we have only achieved five. Because while some benefit from the crisis, others continue to pay its consequences, and grand figures are not enough for us. We are interested in people, and we want economic growth to translate into people, the men and women of Europe, being able to live better lives with more social justice. We must change economic governance. We want a social and solidarity economy, and for that, it is necessary to strengthen the European Semester, so that it includes the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the pillar of social rights. And we also need to reform the monetary union. We cannot wait for another crisis to reform the Eurozone, to provide it with fiscal capacity and a deposit guarantee. But we will not be able to achieve these objectives if we do not also work on a global agenda. We want a strong Europe, to promote human rights, labour, and environmental standards in multilateral agreements. Citizens expect more from us: they expect us to defend social achievements, such as sexual and reproductive rights or the rights of the LGBTI community; to continue making progress so that unjust situations like the gender pay gap are ended once and for all. And, of course, it is in our hands to end the greatest social scourge currently affecting Europe, which is gender-based violence, women who continue to be murdered simply for being women. And, of course, because we are here to provide answers now, we cannot wait any longer. We are here to build a strong Europe based on the values of equality, solidarity, sustainability, and justice, and we will work hand in hand with anyone who defends these objectives. Let us not betray the trust of those who have placed it in us.\n",

I can only express my hope that, together with the new 'Renew Europe' group, we will make the voice of this Parliament heard more. For this voice to be heard more, we primarily need a democratisation of the appointment process for leadership positions in the European Union. These proposals must start from here, because otherwise we can discuss names, we can discuss gender balance, we can discuss geographical balance, but as long as we don't have a democratic and transparent process for electing those who are to lead Europe, we cannot be satisfied. Yes, this time we have some proposals. The colleagues who preceded me in their interventions have expressed their opinions regarding how these individuals were selected. We do not have balance, Mr President, we certainly do not have geographical balance. Eastern Europe, unfortunately, is no longer represented as it was when you were appointed to the position you currently hold. Therefore, we need a way to take into account everything stipulated by the Treaty on European Union, and these things must be translated into a democratic process. Dear Popular and Socialist colleagues, if we truly want a democratic spirit and if we want these lead candidates to be truly representative, let us consider how we can establish a system of transnational electoral lists or lists through which these candidates can be accessible to all European citizens, not just German citizens, not just French or Spanish or Dutch citizens, and so on. These 'Spitzenkandidaten' will be legitimate when every European citizen has access to them and can vote for them. We propose that we do this, and that we start it here in Parliament, because we cannot expect either the Commission or the Council to do something that is our responsibility. The 'Renew Europe' group proposes to you, and will propose to both the Council and Parliament, that we organize a European conference, a conference for the renewal of Europe, for the democratisation of the electoral process, a conference of a sufficiently long duration – two years, two and a half years – which would make proposals together with the Commission, with the Council, with citizens, with non-governmental organisations, to come up with proposals on how we can improve the process we have. I fully agree with Mr González Pons, I fully agree with Iratxe García Pérez that we need people who truly represent Europeans and from whom the Council can then choose. But let's formalise this process, so that we no longer waste time arguing with exchanges of ideas and opinions when it's already too late, when the Council has to choose, and when we have to be able to decide! Let's use this mandate so that by the next elections we have such a mechanism already agreed with Parliament, with the Council, and with the Member States, and let's stop wasting time throwing insults at each other and show European citizens that we are capable of making decisions and capable of representing them! This is what we propose to you, I hope we will have your support, because we have time, from now until the next elections, to go through this process.\n",

      "\tSecondly, European values and the rule of law, respect for human rights, from our point of view and for us, are non-negotiable, and their violation means undermining democracy. That is why it is very important for us that in this legislative term we can discuss a set of legislative proposals for the protection of the rule of law and fundamental rights, and an effective mechanism that includes sanctions for all Member States; to have this very clear mechanism that plays primarily a preventive role, but also to know exactly what awaits each Member State that violates the rule of law and disrespects justice. Furthermore, we must conclude the process of appointing the European Prosecutor as quickly as possible. We have waited too long for this. This institution must be functional as soon as possible to protect the financial interests of the European Union from corruption and fraud, but, above all, to send a very clear signal that the European Union knows not only how to punish, but also how to prevent, and that European institutions have the tools to do so.\n",

The message must be very clear for the future European Commission regarding these objectives that we also have in Parliament. In this context, the adoption of the new Strategic Agenda 2019-2024, which the Council adopted, is an important step, but it is not enough. From our point of view, we must have such a political agenda established here in the European Parliament. I hope we can continue and complete the process we started with the pro-European political groups in Parliament, through which we establish these priorities and can place them before the future leadership of the European Commission as quickly as possible. Parliament must play a key role in establishing these priorities, and we must do this now, before the appointment of the future President of the European Commission. Otherwise, we risk it being too late again. It is our responsibility, the responsibility of the pro-European political forces in this Parliament, to lay before the future European Commission the strategic priorities of Parliament.

In such a scenario, the European Parliament would have asserted, as never before, its capacity to be the primary democratic expression of the Union's citizens.

A Europe at the forefront of the fight for the preservation of our climate, biodiversity, and natural resources; a Europe championing the fight for social, fiscal, economic justice, and for gender equality; a Europe at the forefront of defending human rights and freedoms, and an ever more participatory democracy.

      "\tMr President, President Tusk, honourable colleagues, once again the European institutions have offered an undignified spectacle to the citizens. Anyone who, after the electoral campaign, after the elections of 26 May, had the slightest hope for a change in methods and programmes has been disappointed. The spectacle that has been offered and the interinstitutional clash we have seen unfold in recent days is truly something that European citizens will not be able to understand. The Council decided to throw a questionable method, which Parliament tried to defend, that of the lead candidate , into the bin, and today Parliament and the parliamentary groups complain that there was no respect in the package agreed between the Heads of State and Government. And here too, you demonstrate your hypocrisy and your lack of consistency in following up words with actions. If Parliament truly wants to be respected, if Parliament, or the majority in Parliament, truly wants to defend the lead candidate method, then words can be followed by actions. If you truly want to be consistent, you can vote against the candidate that the Council has proposed for the Presidency of the Commission. If you make such a gesture, you can be considered consistent. Otherwise, your words will remain, as always and as you have often demonstrated, mere words, proving once again that this Institution is worthless and has no say in European decisions.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tAs for the package proposed by the Council – and of course, we await the programmatic guidelines – the premises, as already stated, do not bode well for a significant change, the kind that European citizens asked us for on 26 May; they do not bode well for a change of direction that can resolve the problems European citizens are facing and where the majority, which has governed Europe until today, has profoundly failed. The economic crisis: today Europe is the continent that grows the least; it is a continent that is falling behind, and this is the consequence of reckless choices made by these institutions, which not only have not been able to help citizens but very often have exacerbated problems. The issue of internal security: those who were present in the last legislature had to experience two very serious attacks in the two seats of Parliament. Today our citizens are not able to move around our cities safely, and in this regard, these institutions have not been able to provide a response. And the third point concerns the management of migratory flows: as long as we are not able to protect our external borders, as long as we are not able to protect our citizens, these institutions will not only never find an agreement on how to redistribute those who have the right to enter Europe, but the risk is that this continent will be crushed by migratory flows that are unsustainable.\n",

      "\tAs for what the Identity and Democracy group will do in the coming years, despite the fact that this majority or the coming majority has decided, once again, to demonstrate that this Institution is not a democratic Institution, by excluding those who represent almost 20% of the Members of this Assembly, we will continue to work to combat a failing vision of Europe, to combat centralisation in Brussels, and to establish that, if Europe wants to save itself, it must start again from the Member States, from the nation-states, which are the only space of true democracy. We will continue to work to challenge the rhetoric of \"TINA\" (There Is No Alternative), what you propose to us every time to solve European problems, which is to give ever more powers to bureaucrats far removed from citizens. No, this is not the Europe that citizens want. This is not the Europe we want, and if you continue in this direction, Europe truly risks dissolution. The divergences between Member States and between institutions continue to widen, and we will not go in any direction. The Identity and Democracy group will start from this vision: a Europe where Member States guide European cooperation and protect the diversities that you wish to standardise by law.\n",

      "\tMr President, congratulations and all the best. I think the most obvious conclusion that comes from the last Council is that the Spitzenkandidaten mechanism is dead. It is dead and gone. It’s even more dead than the parrot in the Monty Python sketch. I’m not sorry that it is dead because, look, there is nothing about Spitzenkandidat in the Treaties. Not a single sentence, not a single word, nothing. I know of course that the attitude of many people in European politics, including this Chamber, towards the rules and the Treaties has been consistently cavalier, to say the least. Mr Timmermans was not a candidate of the people, of the European people. Mr Timmermans was a candidate of the left-wing political establishment and it is good that he has gone. And I hope he will not return, because essentially the Spitzenkandidat process was to conserve the power of the existing political establishment in Europe, not to open the political space for the people. Far from it. On the contrary. We have problems with rules all the time, and the European Parliament has had consistent problems with respecting the rules. Yesterday we had a lamentable spectacle which showed how a lot of people here are openly disdainful of the rules. President Tusk, of course the Council has no right whatsoever to indicate the Vice-President of the Commission – that is a blatant violation of the Treaty. It is the sole discretionary power of the President of the Commission. So, as I say, the Council is not blameless either. But there is good news, I think. The good news from the last Council is that the EU big guys failed to achieve what they wanted – they wanted to impose their own concept, their own power structure, on the rest of the Member States, with the expectation that it would be humbly accepted. Well it was not, and I hope that some lessons were drawn from that and that it will result in a change of practice. The days when two or three governments and their acolytes could dictate the solutions – even the names – to the entire European continent, are gone. What I am worried about when I hear my predecessor here is that you, ladies and gentlemen, don’t seem to draw any lessons from what happened in the elections. You seem to be determined to continue the same strategy. The number of people who are openly critical of this strategy is increasing. There are more people critical of the strategy now than there were five years ago. And the number is continuing to rise. Yet you seem to be blind and deaf – you don’t hear any warning signals, but you should, because if you do not change course then the consequences will be disastrous. As I said, there is a slight signal from the last Council that things might get better – at least I was hopeful of that – but I lost a lot of hope when I came here and listened to what most of you have said. However, when the milk is spilt please remember that I warned you.\n",

We expect nothing less from you than to be a President who stands for transparency, for impartiality, and who also knows how to defend the rights of Parliament against the Council and also against the Commission. This brings me to the actual topic: The Council, Mr President Tusk, has now found a solution in the personnel poker, and some colleagues have complained about the result, although their political families were intensively involved in it. I want to tell you clearly at this point that the real scandal is that such solutions are found in backrooms, that solutions are worked on intransparently, without involving Parliament, and that actually make a mockery of democracy in Europe. The trust of the voters is thereby disappointed, and great damage is done to European democracy. The people outside the backrooms and also outside the upscale restaurants where these talks are said to have taken place get the impression that it's only about positions and no longer about substance. But we, as the Left in the European Parliament, have received a mandate from millions of voters to fight for a progressive political change here in Europe, in the European Union. And we gladly accept this mandate. Now, some groups, some colleagues, have been negotiating intensively with each other in recent weeks and have tried to put together a common coalition agreement. This has also been mentioned – meaning the Greens, the Social Democrats, also the Liberals and also the Conservatives. I think that minimal consensuses do not do justice to the political challenges of our time. The Left Group wants to take effective measures against the climate emergency. For that, progressive majorities are needed in this House. We want to strengthen social rights in the EU, we want to tackle tax dumping, tax evasion, and money laundering. For that, too, progressive majorities are needed in this House. And, Commissioner, the Commission recently celebrated the planned EU-Mercosur free trade agreement with great fanfare. I want to tell you that for my group, it is completely unacceptable that this agreement be signed. It cannot be the policy of the European Union to throw human rights, social rights, environmental standards overboard for a few euros! And furthermore, this agreement is also to be signed with the far-right government in Brazil. It is precisely such a policy that makes the far-right acceptable in the first place! This meets with our firm opposition. No one understands this anymore! I call on my colleagues here in Parliament to take a stand with us against this planned free trade agreement. Yes, the Left Group advocates for a humane migration and asylum policy in the EU that guarantees universal human rights. And yes, we are therefore very pleased that in the confrontation between Captain Carola Rackete and the self-proclaimed Il Capitano, it's one-nil to Carola. I think we can continue like this. We invite the progressive forces in this House: Let us work together on a progressive political change for the European Union!

Respect for the rule of law, therefore, dear colleagues, is our utmost interest and the cornerstone of our civilisation, which keeps us united against threats, whether internal or external.

I also congratulate Mr Tusk, at least from two points of view: the longevity of his mandate and the fact that he had Eastern representation. But, President Tusk, what legacy are you leaving from the Council? A lack of transparency, a total imbalance in the European institutions, between East and West, and I'm not referring only to the leaders of the three institutions, I'm also referring to the officials working in the European institutions. Please check the balance between employees in the European institutions, between Eastern and Western states. And what else are you leaving, Mr President? An incoherent strategy regarding the enlargement of the European Union, a procedure inconsistent with democracy, namely, the majority in the Council, and you are leaving two states punished - Bulgaria and Romania - even though we have the Parliament's resolution, Mr President, and you promised countless times that you would end your mandate with Romania and Bulgaria in Schengen, because we have met all the technical conditions since 2011. And what else are you leaving, Mr President? You leave the impression that everything is arranged behind a curtain, and this does not encourage European citizens to increase their trust in the European Union. Therefore, dear new colleagues, please understand that it depends on us to increase the importance and power of the European Parliament.

However, in this last election, it is the first time that voter turnout has risen above 50% after having declined election after election. Why? Because of the motivating force that when citizens vote, they decisively influence the leadership of the European Commission, its presidency, and you have been unable to exercise your authority to preserve the candidates who faced the electorate, not even candidate Frans Timmermans, who was vetoed by states that were called to account, precisely because of Timmermans' defense of the rule of law and democracy. But this Parliament has the final say not only in the investiture of the candidate for President of the Commission but also in that of each and every one of the twenty-eight candidates to be members of the Commission. And it would do well to rigorously examine and reject those who do not commit to the social, climate, and digital challenges, but also to the approach to migration, which must be changed to prevent the criminalization of those who save lives at sea — as has been done with the captain of the Sea Watch — or to ensure that the European Union lives up to its humanitarian action to prevent returns to unsafe countries like Libya — where a refugee camp has been bombed with a criminal toll of forty fatalities.\n",

Secondly, as regards the Spitzenkandidat, the role is clear. The Council is insisting on its role, which is legally defined in the Lisbon Treaty, and that is fine. However, I also see that the same personalities who stressed, in the informal meeting on Friday, the role of the Council are part of the party meetings, and there they are supporting the process to nominate candidates in the party format. My party will do this in Helsinki in November. That is agreed upon and that is what we will do. Frans Timmermans explained once again what parliamentary democracy means. It is not the biggest group which will have the chance, but only the candidate who can organise a majority will have the chance to be elected as Commission President. However, one thing is again crystal clear: nobody will be elected from this Parliament and from the next Parliament who was not, before the elections, put forward as a candidate from a democratic party. That is a principle. It is fixed and it has now been approved. The innovation that is ahead of us is that we need not only candidates, but we also really need attractive programmes from the different political parties to show people an alternative and to make a really European campaign. On MFF, things are on the right path. It was a constructive discussion. First of all, we have to make the EU more effective and spend money in a more effective way. Then there are the new tasks on the table, and we will need fresh new money. I sometimes hear the argument that the EU will be smaller. Dear friends, when I look at the tasks on the table – the demands for the African Fund, for the Defence Fund and for strengthening Frontex – I do not see how Europe will be smaller in the next MFF. There are lot of tasks on the table which have to be financed. The last point I want to make in my intervention today is about the most important discussion this week on Brexit, because tomorrow Theresa May will make a speech on this subject. When I look to the outcome and the developments in the last weeks in the British debate, the key question is still what the new relationship between the European Union and Great Britain will look like. One principle is clear for us: a country outside the EU cannot have the same standards and the same rights as a country inside the European Union. It is also clear for us that an endless transition period is not acceptable to us. That is why we welcome today’s presentation of a possible Leave Treaty. One point is still open, and that is the question of what these long-term relationships will look like. We need clarity on this. We hope that, when we listen tomorrow to Theresa May, we will have more clarity, for example on the future relationship with the City of London and how the Open Skies will look in the future. There are many questions on the table and we need a clear idea. I have to pick up one message we received from the UK Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson. When I look at what he said, especially on the question of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, I must say that a politician should try to solve problems and not create problems. Don’t play with the achievements of the past; don’t play with the peace process; don’t play with the future of the young generation in Northern Ireland. The EPP will be on the side of the Irish people: we will not accept a hard border, and will not risk the peace process. That is what we want to achieve. Europe is ready. We hope that London is also already.\n",

      "\tMr President, thank you for informing us about what Mr Tusk told you regarding the conclusions. Frans Timmermans on behalf of the Commission, thank you for drawing the conclusions, a lot of which we share, not all of them but a lot. But the main question today is: where is the European Council? I haven’t met the European Council on the floors of this chamber. I have not seen them here. Thanks to our Bulgarian colleagues, there is not even an empty chair and there is not even an elephant in the room. There’s just nothing. I do not regret that, my dear colleague Manfred Weber – I find it a scandal – because this is about the future of Europe, and where is the President of the European Council? He will learn to take this House seriously, and he and his colleagues will learn to take this Chamber of European parliamentarians seriously because it’s about our common future, and we will not give in on these kinds of procedures. The future of Europe is about money – of course. That's why it's completely incomprehensible why so little comes out of it. These informal summits were introduced to make things easier, so that you can speak more confidently. But what is the result? What should the formal summits look like when the informal ones already reveal so little? Of course we agree to take on new tasks. Of course we know that Europe has to take care of a decent refugee policy and that we have to ensure that migration issues are dealt with sensibly. And that we care about security, old security issues - new security issues. That is our clear position. But how is this supposed to work without additional funding? Where is the commitment from the ladies and gentlemen in the European Council to allow us more of this? And in particular: where is the question of own resources? Thank you, Mr. President, for mentioning this again, that is how we discussed it. But why - it is in the hands of the people in the European Council - not finally a financial transaction tax that contributes to Europe's budget? Why not finally impose a tax on the multinationals that do business online without paying decent taxes? It's high time for that, and that's exactly what has to happen, that's exactly what has to be implemented. We are waiting for it. The European Council says that it does not agree or cannot guarantee that the leading candidates will be proposed at the end of the day or that the election will take place from among the leading candidates. We have to say to Mister Tusk and the colleagues: We could not care less. Why? We couldn't care less, because the question of whether the European parties nominate top candidates is not the property of the European Council, but of European civil society, and the parties and the citizens will make a decision on this, and not the rulers and the ladies in the European Council, it won't be like that! That is why I make it very clear: This House has committed itself not to elect anyone who has not faced this democratic competition for programs and people. We in the Socialist Group will certainly not do that because we were the pioneers of this process. We will not elect anyone who withdraws from democratic competition. We will no longer condone backroom events. We want democracy for European citizens.\n",

      "\tMr President, with friends like that, who needs enemies? Can I come back another time? (Referring toremarks made by members of the EFDDGroup.) So what came out of last Friday’s Council meeting? A clear signal that there is still a long way to go to persuade Member States to sign up to a bigger budget and also how to select the next Commission President. A number of EU Member State governments know that their voters do not want them to simply sign blank cheques to fund the ambitions of the Commission and the leaders of two or three of the larger Member States. Members of this House can no longer dismiss those voters, those politicians and those governments who question the agenda of political integration or simply label them as being anti-EU, for once you step outside the EU bubble, it is clear that the call for more Europe, whatever the problem, is the voice of an elite, not the voice of citizens in many of our countries. National governments and voters want to feel that they get value out of the EU for what they pay in. Not all of them want to see a 1950s agenda of political integration. On the whole, the voters want to see a budget that is well managed and matches their priorities, a budget that provides security and well—functioning asylum and immigration systems, and a budget that encourages a cleaner environment, innovation and job creation. But – and members of the ECR Group would want me to be very clear on this point – a budget should not be used to buy solidarity, to bribe Member States into taking asylum seekers, or to control or punish the actions of individual Member States, especially when the Member State pushing for the policy itself broke the rules and, in the process, nearly destroyed the EU’s asylum system. So, as President Tusk has already admitted, agreeing a budget before the next election is probably unrealistic, but even if all of you here and the EU institutions cannot agree on a budget, those politicians facing their electorates in 2019 should all be clear about what modernising the budget really means, about how the EU will face the massive hole after the UK leaves, and whether the EU budget will be one of coercion rather than cooperation between 27 equal Member States. So the ECR Group’s question to the Council and the Commission is simple: Is the EU facing a future where decisions continue to be made by all 27 Member States, or a future where decisions are dictated by the few?\n",

      "\tMr President, first of all we have to thank Mr Kamall for all the recommendations he is giving for the next budget, in which Britain will no longer be involved. Thank you Mr Kamall. Secondly, I think we have to pay you, Mr President, a double salary in February because you have taken over the role of Mr Tusk today and that is significant because you, Mr Timmermans, spoke of the idea of ‘one hat’ in the European Union, and we have proved that it is possible for the Commission to double-hat for the Council. The only other thing, maybe, is that you can go over to the other side once, and then come back. But I will not go over the whole discussion that you had in that informal Council about Spitzenkandidaten and transnational lists. I have already said what I think about that, namely that you are making an enormous strategic mistake. You are endangering the Spitzenkandidat concept by not embedding it in a democratic process in a transnational list. The reality is that the Spitzenkandidat continues to be a toy of political parties and again between the Council on the one hand and Parliament on the other, but there is no legitimacy on the democratic front. Transnational lists provide precisely that – putting the Spitzenkandidat concept into a democratic process so it is our people who decide who is elected, and then the European Council could no longer object to the outcome of such an election. But okay: Rome was not built, as you know Mr President, in a day, and the same is true of transnational democracy. We will come back to this in 2024. On the issue of the budget, I have been involved three times in the adoption of the Multiannual Financial Framework , twice as a member of the Council and once as a Member of the European Parliament, and my fear is very simple, Mr Timmermans: that it will be business as usual. It will be a budget for seven years in which the next Parliament will have no say – no say in five years! Secondly, I fear it will be again a list of 50-60 rebates, exceptions, earmarkings, and exceptional monies to buy the support of all the Member States, and 80% of it will be money paid by the Member States going back to the Member States, and not going to the new priorities that we have – border management, innovation, migration, defence and things like that. So my appeal to all the political groups represented here is: let’s break the cycle of this European budget. Let’s make an agreement, together with the Commission, on the priorities. Secondly, on conditionality: will we continue to hear, for example, that Mr Orban is misusing European money to build a football stadium in his town, or to make his friends and family multimillionaires on the basis of European money? No! Let us establish conditionality: if you don’t accept the values, you don’t need our money. That must be the principle. And thirdly, on the issue of our responsibility. This is the only Parliament, colleagues, which has no say about income: the only one worldwide which has nothing to say about revenue. That has to change, and that means Article 311 of the Treaty, once there is a change to the Treaty, will need to incorporate co-decision by the European Parliament on income. My plea to you – and it is more important for me than the period of five years or of seven years – is that, for once, we have can cohesion in this Parliament, unity in this Parliament, on our refusal ever to accept an MFF without co-decision by Parliament on the issue of revenue. That said, if we do not decide before the next election, it will not be the fault of this Parliament. I’m pretty sure that the European Council will not be capable of reaching agreement on the next MFF before the elections.\n",

      "\tMr. President, the results of the informal Council unfortunately confirm that the Union continues the same neoliberal policies, circumventing declared principles as well as the interests of the people. In relation to the multi-annual budgetary framework, instead of discussing solidarity measures to deal with the refugee crisis, it was proposed to increase spending on the creation of Fortress Europe, by strengthening borders and patrols. Union leaders also agreed to increase investment in the military industry instead of proposing measures to support the real economy, to promote funds and investments for social and regional cohesion, to fight poverty, for employment and the creation of new quality jobs work. The policies they are promoting will not benefit the people but will lead to new conflicts, to new waves of refugees. The current humanitarian crisis in Syria is, I think, typical. Regarding the relations of the European Union with Turkey, the declaration-appeal after the informal Council of President Tusk to end the violations in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean is positive but not enough. Turkey prevented a drilling rig of the European Italian company ENI from proceeding with exploratory drilling in the Cyprus Exclusive Economic Zone and to this day continues to violate international law and the Law of the Sea with illegal Navtex. It continues the flagrant violations of the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus. We therefore expect practical solidarity from the European Union and more drastic measures, i.e. we expect pressure to be exerted on Turkey to immediately stop the illegal actions, to respect the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus and to support the resumption of the talks from where they left off during the last talks in Crans-Montana, so that we can finally lead to the solution of the Cyprus issue. I would like to remind you that on the issue of the future management of natural gas there have already been convergences between the two leaders of the two communities since 2010, to which UN Secretary General António Guterres also refers in his latest report. These convergences resolve the issue as a whole in the interest of the entire Cypriot people, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, since with the solution of the Cypriot conflict and the reunification of Cyprus, both will reap the benefits of natural gas.\n",

      "\tMr President, how we set up our long—term budget obviously reflects how we want to deal with the European Union overall, and there I do see some cause for concern. Some Member States say they just want to have enough money for their national pet projects, they want money for their farmers, they want internal security and external security, a lot of things, but they also want to pay less money, and that simply cannot work because a strong and active European Union needs resources. That does not mean that we can just spend it how we want. We have to be careful with where we invest taxpayers’ money, and I can think of quite a few cases where we can save on some of them, from big pie—in—the—sky projects like ITER to the way we choose to travel ourselves, dear colleagues. There are also plenty of examples of how EU money is being misspent in the Member States, and there we need more control and more guidance before the damage is done. EU money always needs to be spent well and in the interests of the people living in Europe, and it must never, ever contribute to corruption. The fight between Member States about who should pay what shows that we need to put the EU’s budget on a more independent footing. Own resources should be introduced now and we think they should be done in a way that enables us to actually tax and take the money from what is destroying our very own habitat. The budget will always reflect what we value most. It is a tool to finance the vision that we have for this place where we all live, for the future, and we must put the money where we think the EU should be going. We should not forget either that we have actually agreed some important international commitments. I am thinking of the Paris Agreement and climate protection, sustainable development goals, to name just a few. But money alone does not bring happiness. What we also need in the Union is a strengthened European debate and to bring decision-making closer to EU citizens, and that is where the whole discussion about the leading candidates comes in. Sure, that concept does not solve all the problems that we have, but it was – and it is – a vital step forward for a more accountable Commission and, more generally, a more accountable European Union. If Member States were to give up that progress because they were afraid that they themselves might not win or because they prefer to have some backroom deals, then this really is a slap in the face of European democracy, and whoever goes down that path should not be surprised if Europe herself gets up at some point and slaps back.\n",

I will say something about Brexit. What the Commission is proposing is not a withdrawal agreement so much as a ‘UK not really leaving at all’ agreement – leaving in name, but not in reality. You intend to impede and delay that process and overturn it if at all possible. Now I do not blame you, because you do not want us to leave and you have no incentive whatsoever to help us do it, but I do blame the British Prime Minister. What Britain needs now is a leader with the courage and spirit of a Boadicea, and instead we have got ‘Theresa the Appeaser’. In the referendum, the British people voted to leave the European Union, and what that means is that we don’t give any more money to the European Union. It means we are not bound by European Union law. It means we don’t have open borders and it means that we are not subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. To make that happen, the Government should take control of the process. The British Government should stop asking the European Union how it might leave please, and it should start telling them how it’s going to work.\n",

But now that England is leaving the EU, there is less money, much less: between 14 and 25 billion euros per year. Most Member States, we heard on Friday, do not want to pay more. And so Mr Verhofstadt, the ALDE Group calls, for direct EU taxes. That solves the problem. You don't see it in the national budget, but the citizen does pay for it. The other Europhile parties here agree with this. The citizen is screwed again. The citizen pays for this failing project. I tell you: the EU should not spend more, but less. The budget should not be higher, but lower. Citizens should not pay more, but less.

These are principles that we should not argue about, and this should not be understood as pressuring people. But I would like to say one thing about the European Council and ultimately just take up one topic. A year before the European elections, that is the question of how we can bring our political project even more clearly to voters. There was a crucial point in the Treaty of Lisbon, which we rehearsed last time when we were electing the President of the Commission, but which the political parties have not yet brought into the political debate in full and in the same way everywhere: that is the question of the top candidate. We want the future to proceed as the Treaty provides - and we will not allow the European Council to pursue its own interests in the back rooms. We would like to state that in the future the head of the European administration will be elected by voters through the European Parliament, as the Treaty provides, and that this will not be a caprice between heads of government. If we do not bring this Europe closer to the citizens in the decisive positions, then this Europe will have no chance in the long term.

Of course we need to cope with new challenges – for example, managing migration means Europe delivering on better cooperation in development and peace-building with its entire neighbourhood – that’s for sure. But Europe also need to be ambitious on programmes which have proved to be a success, such as Erasmus, the programme for science and technology or the youth initiative. Most of all, we need to ensure strong means to provide social and territorial cohesion in Europe, because without that there is no unity among European citizens. This also means – because convergence is a central problem for us – that, when it comes to the eurozone, we need to include a fiscal capacity in the upcoming Multiannual Financial Framework. So how can we deliver on all this? Well, the answer is easy. We have to accept, once and for all, that we need new own resources to finance our common budget. And there is a further matter on which the leaders were too shy, namely the right way to understand European democracy, because some of them are hesitant about the need for European parties to put up their own candidates in European elections, presenting their own programmes in such a way that citizens can choose not only legislators but also executive power.

There are very complex logistical supply chains in danger – customer relationships, supplier relationships – and, in the end, Britain will become the largest British customer. I wonder why we are continuing to try to punish Britain for their decision. Instead the Commission should focus on placing the interests of the European Union as priority number one. Those interests are very similar to Britain’s interests. Any deal which is good for British industry is also a very good deal for European industry, and that is why I believe we should change the Commission’s priorities.

On the budget, it’s clear that it’s not set in stone. We need to adopt the budget so it represents the real needs and concerns of our citizens. We wholeheartedly support additional EU spending to stop illegal migration, trafficking and to counter human smugglers and criminal networks who prey on those who are already most vulnerable. But at the same time Europe cannot and will not isolate itself from the world. We need to step up our engagement with and in Africa. The MFF should be a cornerstone in a new Marshall Plan for Africa, so we can help those who are most vulnerable more, help them sooner and help them where they are.\n",

      "\tMr President, for those who defend the advancement of the European project, the conclusions of the last informal Council are a cause for concern, but in one thing the Council did well, by endorsing the proposal that was approved here in this Parliament on the recomposition of the European Parliament and which was approved by a large majority and in which I had the honor of being co-rapporteur. On a difficult issue, Parliament proved that it was capable of generating fair solutions and broad consensus. The Council would do well to listen more to this Parliament also on other issues, such as the Multiannual Financial Framework. O Sr. Commissioner told us here that one of the biggest threats to the future of the European project is the worsening of divergences. Today, there are those in the Council and the Commission who defend cuts in cohesion and convergence policies. It would be good if this European Parliament was listened to there too.\n",

It is a very important discussion because it has to do with the future, it has to do with the future of our businesses, of research, of work, of our young people, of the environment, that is, it has to do with the idea we have of Europe from here on, in the next seven years. To do this we need - we wrote it in our documents, we said it to the Commission and the Council - a budget that is strong, a budget that is able to respond to citizens' expectations, that is able to respond to the expectations of our businesses, of our economic world, of our world of work. To have a strong budget, you need to have European resources, very strong own resources: on this it seems to me that there is very little push from the Council and that there is no will to move forward. We, however, believe that it is necessary to free up resources for the Member States and, at the same time, to have a Europe that is able to provide for at least 50% of its needs, of its budget, on its own. These are the expectations not only of this Parliament, but they are the expectations for the future of the citizens of Europe.\n",

But, when Erdoğan intervenes in the southern sea of Cyprus which is also a sea of the European Union, we have no choice but to discuss this matter. How many crimes does this regime have to commit before we finally act? It continues the illegal occupation of the Northern part of Cyprus. It ended the rule of law within Turkey. It imprisons any dissenting opinion. It is exterminating the Kurds and every other people inside Turkey. He has been allied for so many years with the jihadists who, as we all know, he is funding and using today in the attack on Afrin. The last event of course is the raid on the Exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus and the Aegean. I think that if we just stick to condemnatory statements and words this time, we will have failed and will soon regret it. Catch-the-eye procedure\n",

I believe that these actions are directed directly against the European Union. When it violates the Exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus, it violates the external and maritime borders of the European Union. When it targets the energy plans of Cyprus, it targets and hits the European Union itself. When Turkey obstructs European companies, such as ENI and TOTAL, it hurts European Union companies, it hurts the very interests of the EU. Turkey today, with all these provocative actions, is a challenge and an insult to the European Union itself. Because Turkey only understands the language of sanctions and measures, I believe that we must rethink any Euro-Turkish relations, the upgrading of the Customs Union which is unthinkable and unacceptable, the liberalization of visas for Turkish citizens, but also something more important and most important, on of which the European Parliament also has a say, the financing with funds from the European Funds. This Turkey needs measures and condemnations.\n",

I agree with the Vice-President of the Commission that it is necessary to clearly subscribe to the priorities for the next financial framework of the EU. Those priorities should be security, solving migration, and I am very happy that the European Council signed up to the Erasmus+ program, because education, youth mobility, that is the future of the EU. Also a condition for Turkey to take place next month in Varna, Turkey's activities in the Mediterranean and in Syria must be ended and human rights should also be added, because the imprisonment of journalists and academics is unacceptable to us.

This is very important because, for true federalists and true pro-Europeans, there is no experience of a joint and single constituency in the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany or in Switzerland. This would create an imbalance between the countries. If you want to change the rules in Parliament on the balance of the countries, you have to change it first in the Council and then we will see. Finally, I fully understand the position of the Council in the Spitzenkandidaten issue, but they also have to understand ours, because we have to approve the candidate, we have to approve their programme, and we have to approve the College.

This aggression, among others, gives the trigger for a new wave of military armaments in Greece and Turkey, as evidenced by Eurostat and NATO figures, thereby taking away important resources that could be used for the welfare of the two peoples. The European Council reacted to this aggression by Turkey with a politically hypocritical announcement in my opinion, with which it simply asks Turkey to stop provocative actions against Greece and Cyprus, and I say politically hypocritical because it is the European war industries that continue to sell weapons to Turkey, because they gain the most from the tension between Greece and Turkey. After all, in the framework of the multi-year budgetary framework, we are asking for an increase in military spending. People want peaceful resolution of disputes. On the contrary, it is the imperialist designs of NATO and the interests of the war industry of the European Union that seek instability ...\n",

The Council called for the immediate implementation of a ceasefire. Fortunately, this ceasefire was declared, although, in the meantime, there have been violations of it. This is a first step, but we cannot forget that this first step has already been taken in the past, without creating the conditions for the establishment of lasting peace. The European Union and its Member States must act in an uncompromising manner and without excluding from the outset the use of stronger forms of intervention, if necessary, to put an end once and for all to this tragedy, which it takes lives, destroys a country and shames humanity.\n",

Facing the numerous security challenges arising from the south and east, reinforcing border management through the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and showing European solidarity with Africa represent new engagements that require new capital. Furthermore, I would like to stress that, in the new EU27 format, the budgetary gap caused by Brexit should not under any circumstances be filled by resources from our European fundamental policies such as the cohesion fund or the common agriculture policy , given the alarming effects that scenario could produce on our societies. Therefore, I salute the decisions of the Member States that have already expressed their agreement on an increased budgetary contribution, and I would remind the ones that have not done so that the European project brings to each of us incomparably more gains than our expenditure. I will end by making a comparison: while the EU’s annual budget is below 1% of Europe’s GDP, the federal budget of the United States is equivalent to 30% of its GDP.\n",

      "\tThe informal Council meeting discussed the make-up of the upcoming European Parliament, including the so-called ‘Spitzenkandidaten’ process to elect the President of the Commission. This issue needs to be given further consideration both by the European Parliament and by the Council. Both sides seem to be making assumptions about democracy and political legitimacy that have little to no resonance among European people. Another point discussed was the upcoming Multiannual Financial Framework. Given new priorities and the funding vacuum being created through Brexit, there is clearly a need to explore other ways of funding. When proposing own resources for EU funding, the economic sensitivities of each Member State must be duly respected. Similarly, new funding priorities should not downgrade cohesion as a crucial tool of European policy. They must take into consideration the different constitutions of the Member States. Defence has now emerged for some as a leading priority. The EU as of now is not a military union. Defence spending should be kept separate from the common MFF. This would allow those that want to participate in a defence union to do so, without imposing additional burdens on those Member States wishing to opt out.\n",

Tackling effects of the migration crisis is our common endeavour. We have to allocate resources in the financial framework which would help us to tackle migratory challenges. These resources, nevertheless, shouldn’t be unduly mixed with other European issues, such as cohesion policy and structural funds in general. These have been created to underpin a strong European economy and cohesion between Member States within the single market. Creating undue linkages with other sectorial agenda would compromise their effectiveness and added value. This does not mean conditionalities shouldn’t be put in place. The Rule of Law is a basic prerequisite not only for participating in the European project but also in the common market, and they could be included in one way or another in close linkage with the spending of the budget. This does not mean either that we shouldn’t fight to have resources to address migratory pressures. On the contrary, these are needed.

The CAP accounts for 37% of the EU budget, but in the past this share was even twice as high. Direct payments financed from it constitute as much as 50% of farmers' income - income that amounts to only half of the income of other professional groups. Low farmers' incomes are the reason for the lack of young farmers. The financial situation of farmers without the CAP would be catastrophic. Let us remember that the CAP benefits not only farmers, but all consumers, because thanks to CAP funds, food is cheaper and the purchase of production means increases, which also improves the situation of the machinery and chemical industries and trade. The CAP ensured food security in terms of universal access to food of adequate quality and affordable prices. Farmers provide society with a number of public goods in the field of the environment and landscaping, for which they are not remunerated. This situation requires maintaining CAP financing at an unchanged level.\n",

In an increasingly competitive global context, the European Union must make convergence the keyword in all its strategies: internal convergence to take advantage of synergies and its full potential and external convergence with the highest standards of innovation and sustainability . Competitiveness, cohesion, agricultural, migration, security and defense policies must be interconnected with a strong drive for innovation and social inclusion.
