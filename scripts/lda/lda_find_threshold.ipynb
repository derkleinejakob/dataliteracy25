I agree that, broadly speaking, the benefits of vaccination vastly outweigh the risks, and low uptake does lead to disease outbreaks. The World Health Organization, for example, rightly recommends immunity levels of 95% to prevent outbreaks. But there is, of course, some evidence that in a tiny minority of cases vaccination can have negative side effects – specifically as regards autoimmune diseases. But for other illnesses, there are dangers in believing every single scare story. For one major condition, even the national charity responsible describes the proposed link as being ‘comprehensively discredited’. The correlation—causation fallacy lead to all kinds of exaggerations, misinformation and bogus claims made by those who would profit from undermining the principle of vaccination. But, ultimately, there are some risks and it is not for the State to force parents into making a particular decision, and nor should the European Union mandate what nation states must do. So will I support education? Yes. Should we counter misunderstandings and misinformation? Yes. But should we remove parental choice? No.",

However, the physical distance of the threat does not mean greater safety, it may just mean less preparedness in case of real contact. For example, my country, Lithuania, has very few contacts with Ebola outbreaks in Africa. And our doctors learn more about this threat from colleagues or specialized publications, if not from the media. However, this does not mean that Lithuanian doctors are better prepared to fight the possible spread of this virus in Lithuania. Just the opposite - the lack of real medical experience in the event of a possible virus presentation can greatly contribute to the spread of such a threat. In order to avoid the spread of Ebola, as well as other dangerous viruses, it is necessary to promote the exchange of information between all Member States at the EU level, to promote the exchange of doctors, and to provide an opportunity for all those who wish to gain appropriate direct experience. And in this place, the EU can play a very important role, both by disseminating information and by supporting the exchange of specialist experience.",

A pertinent issue, which requires study and in-depth analysis, as the report also states. The consequences of the prophylactic use of antibiotics in livestock farming must be better understood, investigating their relationship with the emergence of resistance in humans. A comprehensive response is required from health systems to the problem of antimicrobial resistance, which includes a range of preventive practices, both at the level of primary health care and at the hospital level. This will not be entirely possible except within the framework of public management of health services. A reinforcement of public R&D in this field is also required.

Of course I support the call that we have heard relating to the A (H1N1) virus but I want to look much wider: in fact, Commissioner, there are systems that work, and vaccines do work. Look at pneumococcal disease. It is a bacterial infection that causes pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis, and is relatively unknown despite its deadly status as the leading vaccine-preventable killer of children under five worldwide. Pneumococcal bacteria are the leading cause of pneumonia, which takes the lives of two million children every year. This is a global health challenge with solutions. It might interest you to know that the Commission and many Member States have already made pledges to support immunisation in the world’s poorest countries by supporting GAVI, the International Finance Facility for Immunisation, and the pneumococcal Advance Market Commitment (AMC), something you did not mention. But we can and we must do more to prioritise pneumococcal disease within existing health and development efforts and to work with developing countries to do the same. The pneumococcal AMC offers an unprecedented opportunity for countries to protect their children from this preventable killer. Yet the sad fact is that, of the 71 countries that are eligible, fewer than 20 have applied for AMC funding that will save so many lives. I would remind the House that expanded access to essential vaccines is a key lever to achieving Millennium Development Goal 4: a two-thirds reduction in child mortality by 2015. We must make sure that we put these vaccines in the hands of countries that need them most. It is a simple step that will quite simply save millions of children’s lives. There is before this House a written declaration on this matter, including the pooling of patents. I urge Members to sign this and do something that matters.",

We are of course all aware of the urgency and gravity of the situation. Five million people die each year of one of these three diseases. Almost 40 million people are infected by AIDS/HIV, and 90% of them live in developing countries, most of those – 70% – in sub-Saharan Africa. We are also seeing tuberculosis making a comeback. As for malaria, which reappeared in the seventies, it is once again affecting countries in which it had been eradicated. There is no need to say any more, except that the European Union owes it to itself to adopt, quickly, a strategy to combat these diseases effectively. The regulation that we are discussing here defines the framework for Community action. It also creates the legal basis for Europe’s contribution, the aim being to encourage research to develop medicines, treatments and vaccines and to facilitate access to them. This is absolutely vital, because only 10% of research activities concern diseases which are responsible for 90% of disease in the world. We therefore need to carry out public research and encourage the private sector to invest in it. We must also, above all, ensure that these medicines are suitable for the living conditions that prevail in the countries concerned, so that they can be distributed via health systems which are worthy of the name. Finally, we must ensure that the prices are not prohibitive, and here we come back to the problem of intellectual property.

Although EU action in the health sector is limited, the Union should implement a coherent public health strategy to respond to existing threats, taking into account regional and national specificities.

As a result of these conclusions, I believe that this report is important in order to better preserve the health of European women. I agree that awareness campaigns, properly implemented diagnosis in cases of cancer and more useful information about osteoporosis are some small steps that can easily be taken by all Member States and the European Union as a whole.",

Good health is a fundamental right in Europe and, while not denying the considerable progress made in health and safety at work, workers are still exposed to serious health and safety risks. Furthermore, as noted in the EU OSH Policy Framework, effective management of health and safety at work remains a challenge for micro and small businesses. For this reason it is essential to intervene to promote compliance with current legislation and effective management of health and safety at work by these companies. Finally, psychosocial risk factors need to be addressed, which are a growing problem for employers and workers across Europe and which are seen as a major challenge.",

         "Equal access to quality healthcare is a fundamental right recognized internationally, especially in the EU. However, the exercise of this right is still, in some member states, constrained by financial, regional and availability of medical personnel problems. In addition, the economic crisis is leading to cuts in national health care budgets, which implies the need to find solutions to increase the effectiveness of health systems and ensure their sustainability. That is why, by voting for the 2012-2020 eHealth action plan, we voted for improving access to health services, reducing the costs of health services and ensuring greater equality between European citizens. I believe that the e-Health system has great potential and can bring benefits to health professionals, patients, informal caregivers and even public authorities. Therefore, the Commission must continue to work towards the large-scale adoption of eHealth services across the EU. As women are involved at all levels of the health sector, the Commission and Member States must consider women's equal access to eHealth, not only as patients, but also as caregivers, ICT specialists and decision-makers.",

         "(LT) This report proposes simplifying the system so that it would be easier for doctors to work in the EU. I agree with the rapporteur that this would stimulate economic growth and would give the labour market flexibility, but we should try to achieve this without creating a severe shortage of labour in countries like Lithuania. According to a Lithuanian report published earlier this year, the ratio of doctors and nurses per 10 000 inhabitants in Lithuania is one of the highest in Europe. However, an ordinary Lithuanian has to wait several weeks or more in order to get an appointment to see a doctor, particularly a specialist. This is because Lithuania has one of the highest rates of migration of doctors in the EU. Most worrying is the fact that the majority of young talented specialist doctors, such as interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons and vascular surgeons are emigrating. Last year, doctors’ salaries were cut three times, reducing the salaries of some specialists to a few thousand Litas. According to the Lithuanian Union of Doctors, half of all medical graduates go to look for work in Germany, the United Kingdom and Scandinavia. We must provide more incentives to keep doctors from migrating.",

         "Mr President, Commissioner, distinguished colleagues, the proposal for the revision of legislation on medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices was published on 26 September 2012, following the health scandal of the PIP breast implants, which speaks – oh so much! – to the hospital practitioner I once was. Ten years later, the implementation of this legislation is still under discussion. We must unfortunately admit that the application of these regulations is far from resolved. This is due to the excessively low number of notified bodies, responsible notably for certification, but also to a lack of anticipation and a shortage of specialised personnel. For several months now, all stakeholders involved in this assessment have observed this situation and have alerted the competent authorities, industry, and notified bodies. Responding with pragmatic solutions acceptable to all is, of course, imperative. If we are forced once again to adapt the regulation to avoid supply disruptions potentially dangerous for patients, this adaptation must be conceived as entirely provisional, because there is no question of calling into question this regulation, which is necessarily ambitious because it is absolutely essential for the safety of European patients, especially for high-criticality devices. Because patient safety cannot in itself be an adjustment variable, health standards are absolutely essential in our European legislation.",
