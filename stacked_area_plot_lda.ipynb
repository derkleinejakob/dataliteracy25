         "Mr President, I should like to thank you for giving me this opportunity to address the House. I want to register my protest at the lack of facilities for me, as a Deputy within this Chamber. Two and a half years ago, I went to the authorities who were dealing with the building of this new structure and informed them of my requirements as a person with a disability within the Chamber. I was assured at that stage that every facility would be made available. I arrived here last month and spoke with the architects and builders with regard to the seating arrangements within the hemicycle. I also wrote a letter to the former President, informing him of the difficulties that would arise. I arrived here today, after being re-elected to this Parliament, to discover, firstly, that I cannot get from the ‘0’ level of the building to the first level without getting a security card from one of the security services. I was delayed for 24 minutes this morning and 38 minutes last night waiting for someone to come along with a card. Secondly, I cannot sit with my political group within this House because there are no facilities for me to sit with them. Thirdly, it is an absolute disgrace when so much public money has been spent on this new building that we could not give a proper example for the 21st century – for the new millennium – of what kind of an inclusive society the European Parliament wants to see in the future. (Loud and sustained applause ) I should like to finish with a quote from George Bernard Shaw: ‘To hate your fellow man is not the ultimate sin but to be apathetic towards him, that is the essence of inhumanity’. We have seen it here today. I want to register this protest. I will be taking part in the proceedings. But I want my heartfelt objections to be heard by everybody within this Chamber and around Europe when it is being televised today. (Loud and sustained applause )",

      "The creation of a single European railway area can no longer wait. It is necessary to increase the share of rail transport compared to road transport to reduce pollution and road traffic.

      "Almost every one of us has encountered a situation where the take-off of the plane is delayed. Several, especially the so-called low-cost airlines, in such situations do not provide passengers with any compensation for the delayed flight. Currently, only 2% of all passenger claims for compensation are satisfied. That is why I supported the proposal that requires airlines to pay compensation to passengers whose flights are delayed or cancelled. The new rules reduce the length of time the plane is delayed, after which passengers have the right to receive food, a phone call and, if necessary, accommodation from the airline. Also, the new rules provide that passengers have the right to get back the money paid for the flight if it is canceled or delayed for more than three hours, as well as, if necessary, a free flight to the desired destination. The rule changes also mean that passengers can bring a coat, a carry-on bag and one bag of airport purchases into the cabin for free. Likewise, a situation can happen to everyone when the purchased plane ticket cannot be used. In this case, most airlines will not issue a refund. That is why I supported the provisions which provide that the passenger has the right to receive back the paid airport taxes, even if he himself cancels his flight. Not least, airlines will have two months to respond to customer complaints. Failure to meet the deadline will mean that the air carrier agrees to meet the customer's requirements. Paldies! \n",

         "(FR) The record levels of abstention at the European elections in June, particularly in working-class residential districts, showed that Europe is still remote from its citizens. It is not sufficiently transparent in the way it is run. It is oriented too much towards the concerns of the market and big business and not enough towards the concerns of the population, particularly those who have to endure lack of job security, unemployment and poverty. The hearings of the Commissioners-designate made it possible to offer an initial response on the reform of the running of the Commission and the strengthening of links with Parliament. But it is on the basis of the policies implemented that Europe will be judged and that the confidence of the citizens must be regained. What are the prospects for social Europe? What protection mechanisms when confronted with economic forces increasingly dominated by the financial world? What new employment policy? What major collective projects to prepare the way for the future and to sustain growth? What will Europe’s environment and its concept of sustainable development be like? And, going on from that, what approach to negotiations with the WTO in order to defend the uniqueness of the European social model and to promote a new type of co-operation between the countries of North and South? On these questions, the statement by President Prodi did not provide the expected responses. The guidelines presented are still far removed from the priorities which were at the centre of the campaign by Socialists, in France and also in many other countries. We have no doubts as to the character, the honesty and the competence of the Commissioners-designate. From this point of view, the personal attacks, with no real justification, by a party of the right and of the extreme Right upon a Socialist leader are unacceptable. The vote of no confidence which they are calling for must be rejected. I shall vote in favour of the appointment. But this approval of the membership of the Commission, which must be capable of getting down to work, is not tantamount to a vote of confidence in a political programme which has not yet been presented, which must be debated with Parliament at the earliest opportunity, and which must take into account the aspirations and expectations of the citizens of Europe.",

What we have to do today is to assess whether the Commissioners-designate are up to the task of fulfilling their assignments competently and with due seriousness. There is nothing in what we have learnt during the Commissioners’ hearings to justify, at this stage, a veto on any one of them in particular. Let us say that they can enjoy the benefit of the doubt at this early stage. The fact remains that, in his speech to the European Parliament, Romano Prodi made statements which can only disappoint and worry those who are waiting for rapid and bold responses from the European Union in order to re-align Europe to be at the service of people and humanity rather than of finance and of the great God, money, for Europe to put itself forward as an alternative to world-wide liberalisation. Mr Prodi’s silence on the subject of the need to defend the European Social Model, his irritating reticence, his frequent omissions on the subject of a European policy to promote employment and his tentative generalities on institutional change, give us rather more than reservations. This is why in the vote on the nomination of Mr Prodi, I voted against. In anticipation of the essential reorientation of the political paths of the Commission and of the debate on the action to be taken, a vote in favour today must be interpreted as a choice not to multiply crises, blockages, in our institutions, and as a refusal to look for individual scapegoats when it is the orientation of Europe in terms of politics and civilisation which is in question. This vote is, to some extent, purely administrative. My vote is not therefore a challenge to the Commissioners-designate. Nor is it a vote of confidence. I expect the new Commission to earn this confidence.

         "My main consideration in passing judgement on the Prodi Commission is whether this team of 20 has convinced me of its ability to significantly restore public confidence in the European Union and its institutions. Regrettably, following the individual hearings and the various statements of Mr Prodi, I remain unconvinced. The strong pressure on MEPs to approve the new Commission, thus allowing a return to ‘normal’ business, must be balanced against the many doubts and reservations which surround aspects of the Prodi team. Mr Prodi views the Commission as a Government for Europe. That concept is not one which I would be inclined to vote in favour of, but even if I did feel so inclined, I could not give a positive vote for this Commission-Designate to fulfil such a role. I want to see real and radical improvement in management and financial control within the Commission. I want to see genuine change in the Commission’s attitude towards the European Parliament. I want a Commission which is seen to be relevant to the lives and aspirations of our citizens. The only verdict which I can apply to Mr Prodi’s team is ‘Not Proven’ and accordingly register my abstention.",

What is more, there have been elements of Romano Prodi’s conduct which, with good reason, have been interpreted as his striving to establish himself as a sort of head of government, something which has no basis in the current EU treaties and which would mean going further down the road to turning the EU into a state. We are therefore voting against the Prodi Commission for the period of 23 January 2000 to 22 January 2005. On the other hand, we will not oppose there being a sort of “caretaker” Commission for the period up until 22 January 2000.
